<p class="p2">Who is there amongst our readers that has not at some time
in his life stood upon the sea-shore to watch the rising tide?
Two mighty powers meet, as it were in conflict, and each in its
turn seems for a time to prevail. Wave rolls after wave, but
each again recedes as if baffled in the struggle and exhausted
by the effort. At one moment the waters gain upon the land;
then in the next the land wins back all that it had lost; and
sometimes even more besides. It is only when some prominent
landmark is reached, which a little while ago stood high and
dry upon the beach, that we can no longer entertain a doubt of
the sure and steady progress of the advancing flood.</p>

<p>Such, as it seems to us, is the conflict which it is the lot of
our age to witness between the flood-tide of infidelity and the
Established Church in these countries. The one is aggressive,
the other is struggling hard to hold its own. On both sides the
contest is carried on with energy and power. To a casual observer
it might perhaps seem that the fortunes of each are almost
equal, and the victory uncertain. But to one who extends the
range of his vision and takes in the distant landmarks, it is
plainly evident that one by one they are fast disappearing, and
that the waves of infidelity are sweeping, slowly indeed, but
irresistibly, over the face of the Established Church.</p>

<p>In the person of Dr. Colenso they have reached at length the
episcopal bench. His brethren, it is true, have taken the alarm,
and have made a show of resistance, but they only demonstrate
their own weakness. Like Canute of old, they command the
waters to advance no further, but their command is vain and
<!--Page 554-->
fruitless. The great flood is still coming in, and they who but
yesterday were considered, from their high position, far removed
from danger, are to-day surrounded by the waves. In this perilous
crisis the Catholic Church alone affords a home of undisturbed
tranquillity to its children, a safe refuge to the stranger.
It stands indeed in the midst of the danger, but its walls are too
strong to be shaken, its foundation too solid to be undermined.
It has been built by its Divine Founder on a rock, and the rain
may descend, and the floods come, and the winds blow and beat
upon that Church, but it falleth not. We have the promise of
God, that her enemies shall not prevail against her; and therefore
we may look out from our impregnable fortress upon the
surging billows with the same calm sense of security as Noah
had when he looked out from the window of the ark on the
waters of the deluge. But though God had resolved that Noah
should be saved from destruction whilst all around were perishing,
yet Noah was not saved without the toil and labour of his
own hands. And so, too, though by a decree of God, error
cannot prevail against His Church, yet has he ordained that the
true faith should be ever defended by human skill and industry.
We hope, therefore, our readers will pardon us if we return once
again to the charges which Dr. Colenso has brought against the
truth of the Bible.</p>

<p>The increase of the children of Israel in Egypt, as represented
in the Mosaic narrative, is Dr. Colenso’s favourite objection. It
is dressed out with the most elaborate ingenuity and care. It is
set forth with even more than his usual confidence. It is held
up as, in itself, sufficient to destroy the historical character of the
whole narrative. By this objection, therefore, we may fairly
suppose that he is willing to stand or fall. We have already
pointed out two fundamental errors in the data from which it is
deduced; many others yet remain, which we now proceed to
expose.</p>

<p><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> There are two suppositions which would contribute very
much to account for the rapid increase of the Israelites in Egypt;
first, intermarriage with the Egyptians; secondly, the practice of
polygamy. For the purpose of our defence it is quite sufficient
that these two customs were <em>possible</em>. Upon Dr. Colenso it devolves
to prove that they <em>did not prevail</em> in point of fact. We
may observe, however, that the Pentateuch indicates clearly
enough the existence of such practices. Judah married a woman
of Canaan (<abbr title="Genesis 33"><cite>Gen.</cite>, xxxiii.</abbr> 2); so did Simeon (<abbr title="46">xlvi.</abbr> 10);
Joseph married an Egyptian (<abbr title="Genesis 41"><cite>Gen.</cite>, xli.</abbr> 25). Why then may
we not suppose that their children intermarried with foreign nations?
Was it impossible for them to imitate the example of
their fathers? We must bear in mind, too, that for 100 years
<!--Page 555-->
at least, the Hebrew people were high in favour at the court of
Pharaoh. During the years of famine they were supported at
the royal expense (<abbr title="Genesis, 45 11; 46 12"><cite>Gen.</cite>, xlv. 11; xlvi. 12</abbr>) while the Egyptians
had to part with their money, their cattle, and even their land,
to pay for food (<abbr title="Genesis 47"><cite>Gen.</cite>, xlvii.</abbr> 13-26): they had “the best of the
land” for their dwelling (<abbr title="Genesis 47"><cite>Gen.</cite>, xlvii.</abbr> 6, 11): above all, they had
for their patron and friend, their kinsman, Joseph who was “lord
of all the house of Pharaoh, and ruler throughout all the land of
Egypt” (<abbr title="Genesis 45"><cite>Gen.</cite>, xlv.</abbr> 8). An alliance with a race so wealthy and
so favoured must have been eagerly courted by the Egyptians:
and, on the other hand, the Israelites would not have been disposed
to decline a connection which would have strengthened
their position in the country and increased their influence.</p>

<p>It does not appear that intermarriage with the Egyptians was
forbidden or even discouraged. On the contrary, an intimate
social intercourse seems to have existed between the two nations.
Even at the very time of the Exodus, we find that it was not
unusual for the Hebrews to receive the Egyptians as guests or
tenants into their houses.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span> It is not an improbable supposition
that such close domestic relations might in many instances lead to
marriage. But we have positive evidence that marriages of this
kind actually did take place, and are in no way reprehended.
Thus we find mention made incidentally of “the son of an Israelitish
woman”, whose <em>father was an Egyptian</em> (<abbr title="Leviticus 24"><cite>Lev.</cite>, xxiv.</abbr> 10).
He was condemned to death for blasphemy when the Israelites
were encamped under Mount Sinai: he must, therefore, have
been born during the sojourn in Egypt. Again we are told of
an Israelite who gave his daughter in marriage to an Egyptian
servant (<abbr title="One Paralipomenon two"><cite>I. Paralip.</cite>, ii.</abbr> 34, 35). This occurred certainly after
the Exodus. But if the two nations <em>sometimes</em> intermarried
when they lived in <em>different</em> countries, may we not suppose that
they <em>frequently</em> intermarried whilst they were living in the <em>same</em>
country? Hence we conclude (1ᵒ) that the mutual relations
which subsisted between the Egyptians and the Hebrews, would
naturally lead to frequent intermarriage; (2ᵒ) that there is not
a particle of evidence to make such a supposition improbable;
(3ᵒ) that there is positive testimony in its favour.</p>

<p>As regards the plurality of wives or concubines,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span> the Israelites
had before them the example of Abraham, who had at least three
(<abbr title="Genesis 16"><cite>Gen.</cite>, xvi.</abbr> 1, 3; <abbr title="25">xxv.</abbr> 1, 6), and of Jacob, who had four (<abbr title="Genesis 29"><cite>Gen.</cite>,
xxix.</abbr> 20, 30; <abbr title="30">xxx.</abbr> 4, 9). The practice of polygamy, therefore,
<!--Page 556-->
had the highest and the holiest sanction in the eyes of the Hebrew
people. It cannot be objected that, during the sojourn in
Egypt, there is no explicit mention of polygamy in the Mosaic
narrative. Moses did not undertake to write a history of the
period. A single chapter in the beginning of Exodus, contains
all that he records of what took place from the death of Jacob to
the birth of Moses. Neither could we expect much information
on this point from the genealogies which are given elsewhere in
the Bible. Every one knows that it was not the ordinary custom
of the Jews to mention the <em>mothers</em> of those whose pedigree
was traced, but only the <em>fathers</em>.</p>

<p>Yet we are not left altogether without distinct testimony to
the practice of polygamy among the Hebrew people in Egypt.
In one family alone of the tribe of Judah we find the following
examples: Hezron, the son of Pharez, had two wives, Abiah,
and the daughter of Machir (<abbr title="One Paralipomenon two">I. <cite>Paralip.</cite>, ii.</abbr> 21, 24). Caleb, the
son of Hezron, had three, Azuba, Jerioth, and Ephrath (<abbr title="One Paralipomenon two">I. <cite>Paralip.</cite>,
ii.</abbr> 18, 19).<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span> Jerameel, another son of Hezron, had two, one
whose name is not given, and another called Atarah (<abbr title="One Paralipomenon two">I. <cite>Paralip.</cite>,
ii.</abbr> 25, 26). Ashur, likewise a son of Hezron, had also two,
Helah and Naarah (<abbr title="One Paralipomenon four">I. <cite>Paralip.</cite>, iv.</abbr> 5). Lastly, we find that Moses
himself clearly recognizes this custom as prevalent. He makes
laws regarding it, to prevent abuses, but he does not forbid it, nor
does he even censure it. “If a man <em>have two wives</em>, one beloved
and another hated, and they have borne him children, both the
beloved and the hated; and if the first-born son be hers that
was hated,… he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for
the first-born, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath”
(<abbr title="Deuteronomy 24"><cite>Deut.</cite>, xxiv.</abbr> 15, 17). With these facts before us, we may judge
what weight is to be attached to the authority of Dr. Colenso
when he states: “There is no indication that polygamy did
prevail among the Hebrews of those days” (p. 120).</p>

<p><abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> Another very probable source of the rapid increase in
population was the accession of fresh servants from without.
The early history of Jacob affords a remarkable illustration of
such an increase. He went into a foreign country <em>without</em> an
invitation (<abbr title="Genesis 18"><cite>Gen.</cite>, xviii.</abbr> 1-5): he <em>served</em> in it for twenty years
(<abbr title="Genesis 31"><cite>Gen.</cite>, xxxi.</abbr> 41): and yet at the end of that time he tells us,
“With my staff passed over this Jordan, and now I am become
as <em>two camps</em>” (<abbr title="Genesis 32"><cite>Gen.</cite>, xxxii.</abbr> 10). The Israelites during the first
half of the sojourn in Egypt, were much more favourably
circumstanced. We have seen that, immediately upon their
descent into Egypt, they received an enormous increase both in
<!--Page 557-->
wealth and importance. This change in their fortunes would
naturally prompt them to add largely to the number of their
servants. On the other hand, the inhabitants of Egypt and
Canaan were sore pressed with famine. They were obliged to
give up first their money, then their cattle, then their land, in
exchange for bread (<abbr title="Genesis 57"><cite>Gen.</cite>, xlvii.</abbr> 13-20). Many must thus have
been reduced to extreme necessity, and nothing would seem to
have remained for them but to accept of service in the households
of their rich and prosperous neighbours. These dependants,
according to the command of God, should have been
circumcised, and thus have been made sharers in the covenant
of which that rite was a token. Their posterity would, therefore,
be reckoned among the 600,000 who followed Moses into
the desert.</p>

<p>To the increase by servants we may add a further increase by
proselytes. It would seem that every facility was offered to
those who wished to become <a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>incorporated with the Hebrew
people. Even in the celebration of the Passover, all were freely
to be admitted if they would submit to the rite of circumcision.
“And if a stranger sojourn with thee, and will keep the Passover
to the Lord, let every male of his be circumcised, and
then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one
that is born in the land” (<abbr title="Exodus 12"><cite>Ex.</cite>, xii.</abbr> 48). It is manifest that
Moses thought it likely, even after a century of bondage and
persecution, that many would still be found to join the fortunes
of this oppressed people. Is it unreasonable, then, to suppose
that such converts were more numerous in the days of their
prosperity?</p>

<p><abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> The average number of children in each family, according
to the calculation of Dr. Colenso, was 4½, or, at the outside,
6&mdash;3 sons and 3 daughters. The manner in which he arrives
at this conclusion is singularly characteristic. He prepares the
way by assuring us that “we have no reason whatever, from the
data furnished by the sacred books themselves, to assume that
they had families materially larger <a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>than those of the present day”
(p. 102). If, however, we turn from the pages of Dr. Colenso
to the pages of the sacred books themselves, we are told a very
different story. “And God spake unto Israel in the visions of
the night,… and he said: I am God, the God of thy father;
fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will make of thee a great
nation” (<abbr title="Genesis 47"><cite>Gen.</cite>, xlvii.</abbr> 2, 3). Such was the promise of God; here
is the fulfilment: “And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in
the country of Goshen; and they held possession of it, and they
<em>grew</em> and <em>multiplied exceedingly</em>” (<abbr title="Genesis 47"><cite>Gen.</cite>, xlvii.</abbr> 27). “And the
children of Israel <em>were fruitful</em>, and <em>increased abundantly</em>, and
<em>multiplied</em>, and <em>waxed exceeding mighty</em>; and <em>the land was filled</em>
<!--Page 558-->
<em>with them</em>…. The more they afflicted them, the more
they multiplied and grew” (<abbr title="Exodus 1"><cite>Ex.</cite>, i.</abbr> 7-12). These words
clearly imply that the people of Israel increased <em>beyond the usual
rate at that time</em> and <em>in that country</em>. We are told, however,
by several ancient writers that the people of Egypt were wont
to increase with extraordinary rapidity.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_4" id="fnanchor_4"></a><a href="#footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span> And yet, in the
face of all this, Dr. Colenso asserts that “we have <em>no reason
whatever</em>, from the data furnished by the Sacred Books themselves,
to assume that they had families materially larger than
those of the present day”.</p>

<p>He next proceeds to establish his average. The twelve sons
of Jacob had between them 54 children, which gives on an
average 4½ to each. It is worthy of note that in making this
estimate, he studiously excludes the family of Jacob himself, who
had <em>twelve sons</em>. If this family had been added to the others,
the average would have been considerably increased. But there
is yet a more radical defect in his argument. The 12 sons of
Jacob had 54 children <em>before</em> the descent into Egypt; how
many had they after? Dr. Colenso <em>assumes</em> that they had none.
His assumption is not only without proof; it is contrary to every
probability. These men were at the time in the full vigour of
life. Reuben the eldest, if we take Dr. Colenso’s own computation,
was about 46; Joseph was but 39; Benjamin younger
still. It is, therefore, most reasonable to suppose that several of
them, if not all, had children born to them during the sojourn
in Egypt. This will be the more evident when we remember
that Jacob, their father, had 12 sons born to him <em>after he had
reached</em> the age of 80; and that Isaac, their grandfather, was 60
when Jacob and Esau were born.</p>

<p>Moreover we can produce a distinct statement with regard to
Joseph, that he had children born to him after the descent,
“And Jacob said unto Joseph: … Thy two sons Ephraim and
Manasseh, who were born unto thee in the land of Egypt,
before I came unto the land of Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and
Manasseh, as Reuben and Simeon shall be mine. And <em>thy issue
which thou begettest after them</em>, shall be thine, and shall be called
after the name of their brethren in their inheritance” (<abbr title="Genesis 48"><cite>Gen.</cite>,
xlviii.</abbr> 3, 5, 6). It may be objected that in the twenty-sixth
chapter of Numbers, where the grandsons of Jacob are enumerated,
no mention is made but of those born before the descent.
We answer, that in that chapter those only are enumerated who
<em>gave their names to families</em>; and it would seem that the grandsons
<!--Page 559-->
of Jacob born after the descent, did not give their names
to families, but, like the younger sons of Joseph, were “called
after the name of their brethren in their inheritance”. We may
observe that this oversight of our author has drawn him into a
twofold error. First, it has led him to <em>underestimate the average
number of children</em> in each family; secondly, it has led him to
<em>underestimate the number of males in the first generation</em>, since
<em>all</em> the grandsons of Jacob, according to his argument, belonged
to the first generation.</p>

<p>Dr. Colenso refers, however, to the genealogies in the sixth
chapter of Exodus (verses 14-25), and elsewhere, to show that
the families during the sojourn in Egypt were not remarkably
large. This argument is of no value if he do not prove that
these genealogies give <em>complete lists of all the sons</em> in each
family. It appears to us that there is no evidence to this effect.
The genealogies were generally introduced for some specific
purpose, as for instance, to trace the pedigree of the most remarkable
men; and for this purpose it was quite unnecessary that <em>all
the members</em> of each family should be distinctly enumerated. A
striking illustration occurs in a passage already quoted: “And the
sons of Pallu; Eliab. And the sons of Eliab; Nemuel and Dathan,
and Abiram” (<abbr title="Numbers 26"><cite>Num.</cite>, xxvi.</abbr> 8, 9).<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_5" id="fnanchor_5"></a><a href="#footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span> It is here explicitly stated
that Pallu had <em>sons</em>; and yet only <em>one</em> is named. Eliab is probably
selected from the rest as he was the father of Dathan and
Abiram; for of them it is immediately added that they were
“famous in the congregation”, and that “they strove against
Moses and against Aaron” in the rebellion of Korah.</p>

<p>Enough, we think, has been said to satisfy our readers that
Dr. Colenso has completely failed in his argument. He has
failed to show “beyond a doubt, that it is quite impossible that
there should have been such a number of the people of Israel in
Egypt, at the time of the Exodus, as to have furnished 600,000
warriors in the prime of life, if we will take the data to be derived
from the <a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>Pentateuch itself” (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 101). On the contrary, we have
proved that there are many circumstances overlooked, misstated,
or denied, by Dr. Colenso, which are quite sufficient to explain
what he regards as impossible. More than this we cannot do.
How far each circumstance in particular contributed to swell the
number of the people, must for ever remain uncertain. While
the sacred narrative is silent on the subject, it would be unreasonable
to ask such a question, and absurd to undertake to
answer it. If we wished to imitate the example of Dr. Colenso,
<!--Page 560-->
we might easily form conjectures, and set them down as facts.
But we believe that such a course would be injurious to the
cause of truth, which we defend. It is much better candidly to
admit that we cannot determine with accuracy the number of
servants that accompanied Jacob into Egypt, or the number of
servants and proselytes that afterwards became incorporated with
the Hebrew people; that we cannot ascertain the precise
number of generations in each family, or the average number
for the entire nation; lastly, that we cannot estimate how far
polygamy and intermarriage with the Egyptians may have conduced
to the wonderful increase of population.</p>

<p>But, though we are unable to say how the population <em>did increase
in point of fact</em>, we can easily show how it <em>may have increased</em>.
For this purpose we venture to lay before our readers
a calculation by which we account for the fact in a manner perfectly
conformable to all the “data of the Pentateuch”. First,
as regards the number of generations. Since a generation is
descent from father to son, the length of time to be allowed for
a generation will be determined in each particular case by the age
of the father when the son is born. This of course will vary for
different families, and even for different members of the same
family. We may, however, fairly suppose that, among the
Hebrew people in Egypt, taking one family with another, every
man on an average had children born to him at the age of 32.
Thus 32 years would be the average length of each generation.
The males of the first generation, as we have before seen, were
all living at least three years before the descent into Egypt, or
218 years before the Exodus. For each succeeding period of 32
years we must add, according to our calculation, one generation
more. In 218 years there are just six periods of 32 years each,
and 26 years over. Therefore the whole of the seventh generation
must have been living 26 years before the Exodus.</p>

<p>Next we may estimate the number of males in the first generation
at a hundred and twenty-five. To this generation would
belong all those, who, at the time of the descent, were above
the age of three, and under the age of thirty-five. Those who
were three, or less than three, should not be counted, since they
belonged to the second generation: those above thirty-five should
be excluded, because when the first generation was completed,
they had already reached the age of thirty-two; therefore, according
to our calculation, they must at that time have had children
who would belong to the first generation; they could not then
belong to it themselves. Now we may suppose that, amongst
the followers of Jacob, there were at least sixty males of various
ages between these two extremes. This estimate will appear
moderate indeed, when we remember that Abraham had been
<!--Page 561-->
able to lead forth an army of 318 <em>trained servants, born in his
house</em> (<abbr title="Genesis 14"><cite>Gen.</cite>, xiv.</abbr> 14). It will not be unreasonable to compute
the accession of extra servants and proselytes at 15. If to these
75 we add 50 as the number of males within the prescribed
limits, in Jacob’s own family, we shall have attained our estimated
figure, 125. Lastly, our readers will find little difficulty
in admitting an average of four sons in each family.</p>

<p>From these data we obtain the following results:</p>

<p>It is certain that a large number of the sixth, and probably a
few of the fifth generation were still living at the time of the
Exodus. Moreover, since the eighth had been coming into
existence during the last period of twenty-six years, many of
that generation must have already attained the age of twenty.
If to all these we add the entire of the seventh generation, we
shall have no difficulty in making up 600,000 men of twenty
years old and upward.</p>

<p>Now we admit that all this calculation is founded on conjectures;
and that it is very likely these conjectures do not in every
respect represent what actually took place. But we maintain
that they are at least possible in themselves, and perfectly consistent
with the narrative of the Pentateuch. Consequently, the
number of the Israelites at the time of the Exodus does not
involve any contradiction, and the thesis of Dr. Colenso is false.</p>

<p>There is another process of calculation by which we may
arrive at the same conclusion. Scientific men have been able to
throw some light on the principles which conduce to a rapid
increase of population. With much research they have collected
statistical tables, which afford results very applicable to our
present inquiry. They have conducted their studies on purely
scientific grounds, and without any special reference to the Bible
narrative. We may, therefore, avail ourselves of their conclusions
as representing the unbiassed opinion of competent and
impartial judges. “It has been constantly remarked”, says
Malthus,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_6" id="fnanchor_6"></a><a href="#footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span> “that all new colonies, settled in healthy countries,
where room and food were abundant, have constantly made a
rapid progress in population. Many of the colonies from ancient
Greece, in the course of one or two centuries, appear to have
rivalled, and even surpassed their mother cities”. He gives
<!--Page 562-->
examples also from the colonies that first settled in North
America. Without any fresh immigrants, the population was
doubled sometimes in twenty-five years, sometimes in twenty-two,
sometimes even in fifteen.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_7" id="fnanchor_7"></a><a href="#footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span> From a table given by Euler,
it appears that a population may double itself in 12⅘ years;
and the author does not hesitate to say that this “is not only a
possible supposition, but has <em>actually occurred</em> for short periods
in more countries than one”.</p>

<p>Now the circumstances of the Israelites in Egypt were peculiarly
favourable to an unusually rapid increase. To say nothing
of the special blessing of God which attended them, they were
dwelling in a country of which the inhabitants were noted for a
remarkable fecundity; the climate was genial; the land fertile;
the means of living abundant. Let us then take a medium
between the extreme figures mentioned above, and suppose that
during the whole period of the sojourn in Egypt, the population
was doubled every eighteen years. This supposition may or
may not be true; but it is certainly not less in harmony with the
repeated declarations of the Pentateuch, than it is with the cold
calculations of science. If our former estimate be accepted, the
total population at the commencement of the sojourn in Egypt
would be about 500; that is to say, four times the number of
males between the ages of three and thirty-five:&mdash;125×4=500.
Upon this foundation we may construct the following <span class="lock">table:&mdash;</span></p>

<table summary="">

<p>Thus it would appear that, if we hearken to the authority of
<!--Page 563-->
scientific men, who have made the principles of population the
subject of their special study, we may still further confirm the
accuracy of those figures which to the mind of Dr. Colenso present
nothing but “multiplied impossibilities”.</p>

<p>We have led our readers a long and weary journey. We
have conducted them through a bewildering labyrinth of names
and numbers, of intricate genealogies and complicated calculations.
Our way indeed lay through the midst of a beautiful
country; and as we passed along, we now and then caught a
glimpse, as it were, from a distance, of some sublime or touching
scene which has many a time inspired the genius of the poet,
the painter, or the sculptor. But we had an end in view which
forbade us to turn aside from our rugged and toilsome path,
even though it were to enjoy the varied charms of the most
ancient, the most simple, the most sacred of histories. Like the
soldiers of Saul, we might not even put forth our hand to taste of
the honey that was dropping from the trees around us. If, however,
like them, we have gained the victory and driven the
enemy from his stronghold, our labours have been richly rewarded,
and our readers have not toiled after us in vain.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Erratum.</span>&mdash;We beg to call attention to an error which occurs
in the last article on Colenso, page 517. The passage to which
we refer is printed thus:&mdash;“According to the Mosaic, etc.…
99,989 families”. Our readers will observe that the number of
families in the case supposed would be 200,000 instead of
100,000. By this alteration the character of the argument remains
unchanged, but its force is considerably increased.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">THE BISHOPS OF OSSORY.</h3>

<p class="p2">When illustrating the lives of the Irish Bishops, Ware and
Harris, as well as our modern annalists, seem to have devoted
special care to the See of Ossory, and hence its series of
bishops is one of the most complete and unbroken that we find
in the history of our Church. It is in the latter half of the fourteenth
century that the first great difficulty occurs. In 1367 a
parliament was held in Kilkenny, and the famous Act was passed
commonly styled, <cite>The Statute of Kilkenny</cite>, which, amongst other
signatures, presents that of “William, Bishop of Ossory”.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_8" id="fnanchor_8"></a><a href="#footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span> Its
accuracy in all the other signatures, and in several minor details,
leaves no doubt as to the genuineness of the prelate’s name, who
at that time ruled the See of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Canice. Nevertheless, such a
<!--Page 564-->
Bishop finds no room in the series of episcopal names given by
Ware and succeeding writers. John of Tatenal, they say, was
appointed to the see in 1360; and his death did not take place
till 1370: thus the above William is altogether excluded from
the episcopal succession.</p>

<p>The chroniclers of the Augustinian order, however, enable us
to solve this difficulty. <cite>John de Tatenal</cite>, or as he is sometimes
called <cite>de Tayenal</cite>, was a member of that distinguished religious
body, and was appointed to the See of Ossory in 1370, the same
year which saw him carried to the tomb.</p>

<p>There was, indeed, another Bishop <em>John</em> appointed in 1361.
On the 20th of November that year, he promised to pay to the
“Camera Apostolica” the diocesan tax of 200 florins, equal to
£40; and it is remarked that this is a proof of the decay of the
revenues of Ossory, since only forty years before, on the appointment
of Bishop Richard, the tax amounted to 700 florins.
On the 9th of January 1361/2 permission was granted to this
bishop to return to his see, and from the brief published in
<cite>Monumenta Vaticana</cite>, <abbr title="page">pag.</abbr> 319, we learn that he had been consecrated
some time before, by Raymond, Bishop of Praeneste,
then resident with the Papal court in Avignon. In 1364
Urban V. (xii. Kal. Aprilis, an. 2ᵒ) granted to him special
faculties and privileges, but no mention is made of him in the
following years. Thus we have full room for Bishop William,
appointed before 1367, and deceased about 1369.</p>

<p>Dr. John Tatenal, as we have seen, was appointed in 1370,
and died before Christmas the same year. <cite>Alexander Petit</cite>
alias <cite>de Balscot</cite>, canon of the Cathedral of Kilkenny, a man of
great learning and wisdom (as Ware writes), was elected by the
chapter to fill the vacant see; and though this election was irregular
and invalid, Gregory <abbr title="Eleven">XI.</abbr> confirmed him as Bishop of
Ossory by Brief of 10th February, 1371. He subsequently was
appointed by the crown to some of the highest offices of the
kingdom, and having held the see for fifteen years, was translated
to Meath in 1386.</p>

<p><span class="person">Richard Northalis</span>, a Carmelite, was next appointed to the
See. His promise to pay the usual tax of 200 florins to the
“Camera Apostolica” is dated 17th <abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 1386/7. He was translated
to Dublin in 1395, not in 1396, as Ware supposed. His
successor <span class="person">Thomas</span>, a Carmelite, surnamed <span class="person">Peverell</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_9" id="fnanchor_9"></a><a href="#footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span> signed the
usual obligation a few days after his appointment on the 3rd of
November, 1395, and after an episcopate of three years, was
translated to Leighlin, on 23rd January, 1398/9, whence on the
2nd July following he was again translated to Llandaff, in Wales
(<cite>Biblioth. Carmelit.</cite>). He was succeeded in Ossory by <span class="person">John</span>
<!--Page 565-->
<span class="person">Wultham</span> (sometimes written <span class="person">Wulcan</span> or <span class="person">Vulcan</span>), who was probably
appointed on the very day of Dr. Peverell’s translation to
Leighlin, and on 1st of February, 1398/9, signed an obligation to
pay the usual tax of 200 florins for himself, and in addition 200
florins for his predecessor Thomas, who had not been as yet able
to satisfy his obligation. This bishop belonged to the order of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Augustine, and was translated to Dromore before the month of
July, 1399. <span class="person">Dr. John Griffin</span>, Bishop of Leighlin, was soon after
translated to our See by brief of “6to Nonas Julii, 1399”, and on
the 12th of July, he signed an obligation “to pay <em>185 florins and
44 solidos</em> as portion of the tax unpaid by his predecessor John,
and in addition 100 florins still due from the time of Dr.
Thomas Peverell”. It is added that no tax was imposed upon
himself, as his appointment was the second one which had been
made within the term of twelve months.</p>

<p>Early in the following year Dr. Griffin was summoned to his
reward, and in May, 1400, another Bishop <span class="person">John</span> was appointed
to the See of Ossory. This bishop is only known to us from the
lists of the Apostolic Chamber. On the 14th of May, an. Dom.
1400, he signed his own individual obligation for the sum of
200 florins, and moreover promised to pay 81 florins and 47
solidos “<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro residuis Domini Johannis prae-antecessoris sui</em>”.
On the 26th of September, the same year (1400), Pope Boniface
IX. advanced <span class="person">Roger de Appleby</span> to the vacant see,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_10" id="fnanchor_10"></a><a href="#footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span> and on the
28th of the same month, it is entered in the books of the Apostolic
chamber, that he <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ratas habuit obligationes, tum Johannis
sui praedecessoris immediati tum alterius Johannis in Floren.
81 et solid. 47: pro se autem nihil obligavit quia fuit facta
promotio bis in anno”</span>.</p>

<p>The successor of Bishop Rogers was according to Ware, the
<span class="person">John Vulcan</span>, whom we have already seen appointed to this see
in 1398/9, and the year 1404 is assigned as the probable date of
his accession. Here again the list of taxes paid to the <i>Camera</i>
comes to our aid. It tells us that, on 17th November, 1402,
“<span class="person">Johannes Walteri</span>”, Bishop elect of Ossory, promised the usual
sum of 200 florins, and also the residue of the former debt of
his predecessor John, <abbr title="namely, florins">viz., flor.</abbr> 81, and <abbr title="solidi">solid.</abbr> 47. It was,
probably, the similarity of name that induced the learned writer
to transplace <a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>Dr. Wultham, and make him successor of Roger
Appleby in the see of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Canice.</p>

<p><span class="person">Thomas Snell</span>, Archdeacon of Glendalough, who had held the
see of Waterford and Lismore since 1399, was next appointed
to this see. Ware, indeed, dates his appointment to Ossory in
1405, but the lists to which we have already so often appealed in
<!--Page 566-->
this paper, attest that he signed the usual obligation on being
appointed to this see on the 11th March, 1407/8. This bishop
bequeathed to his successors a mitre adorned with precious
stones, and presented to his church some richly ornamented
vestments. Rev. William Purcell appeared in the Council of
Constance in the beginning of 1416, as proxy of our bishop, as
we learn from Martene, <cite>Veter. Monument.</cite>, <abbr title="tome 8">tom. vii.</abbr> col. 1222.</p>

<p><span class="person">Patrick Ragged</span> on the death of Bishop Thomas, was translated
from the see of Cork to Ossory, by brief of 15th of December,
1417. An ancient writer gives him the character of “a
prelate who governed his flock with justice and piety, and
instructed them both by word and example.” He was appointed
agent of the <i>Camera Apostolica</i> in Ireland on the 11th January,
1417/8; and he died, not on the 20th of August, as Ware arbitrarily
asserts, but in the first month of 1421.</p>

<p><span class="person">Dionysius O’Dea</span> was appointed to the see vacant <cite>per obitum
Patritii</cite>, by Pope Martin V., in the beginning of August, 1421,
and on the 6th of the same month signed his obligation for the
usual tax of 200 florins assigned for his see.</p>

<p><span class="person">Thomas Barry</span>, or as he is styled in the Roman lists, <span class="person">Thomas
Baury</span>, made the usual declaration on the 5th of April, 1527,
having been appointed some days previous Bishop of Ossory.
During his episcopate, a famous controversy was carried on
before the tribunal of Pope Nicholas <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr>, regarding the parochial
church of Callan, which is described as <span class="person">alias Kilbride</span>, that is,
dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Brigid. This controversy was not decided till
the pontificate of Pope Paul <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, some years after the death of
our Prelate.</p>

<p><span class="person">David Hacket</span>, prior of the Augustinian monastery of Ahassel,
dedicated to <abbr title="Saints">SS.</abbr> Edmund and Martin, and situated in the diocese
of Cashel, was advanced to our see by Pope Pius <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, and was
consecrated <cite>in curia Romana</cite> in the year 1460. When signing
his usual obligation on 14th July, 1460, he is still styled <cite>Episcopus
Ossoriensis electus</cite>. He died, according to Ware, on the
24th October, 1478.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_11" id="fnanchor_11"></a><a href="#footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="person">John O’Hadian</span>, who is styled <span class="person">Hedayn</span> in the Consistorial Acts,
received from the Holy See the Archdeaconries of Cashel and
Ossory on the 8th of January 1459/60 (<cite>Monument. Vatic.</cite>, <abbr title="page">pag.</abbr> 424),
and on the 15th January, 1479, was proclaimed in consistory
<!--Page 567-->
Bishop of Ossory. It is added in the record of his appointment
that, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“die 21 Februarii sequentis consecratus fuit in ecclesia S.
Tryphonis de Urbe a Benedicto Archiepo. Mitilenensi, assistentibus
sibi Stephano Archiepo. Antibarensi et Stephano Sagiensi
Epo”</span>. He was appointed collector of the Apostolic taxes in
Ireland in 1482, and his death is recorded on 6th of January,
1486/7.</p>

<p><span class="person">Oliver Cantwell</span>, who, in various entries of the Vatican
archives, receives the names <span class="person">Cantnel</span> and <span class="person">Wertell</span>, was advanced
to the episcopate in consistory of the 26th March, 1487, the see
being described as vacant <cite>per obitum Joannis extra curiam</cite>. This
illustrious bishop belonged to the order of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dominick, and
De Burgo, in <cite>Hib. Dominic.</cite>, <abbr title="page">pag.</abbr> 478, gives a letter of Innocent
<abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>, dated 27th March, 1487, authorizing him to be consecrated
by any bishop holding communion with the Holy See.
The first years of his episcopate were disturbed by the rebellion
of Lambert Simnel and its accompanying disorders, and we
find published by Rymer a letter of the above-named Pontiff,
Innocent <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>, exhorting the Bishop of Ossory and the other
Prelates of the Irish Church to use their influence in quelling
the rebellious excitement which prevailed throughout our island.
Dr. Cantwell governed the diocese for almost forty years, and in
a very advanced age he passed to his eternal crown on the 9th of
January, 1526/7.</p>

<p><span class="person">Milo Fitzgerald</span>, better known by the family surname of <span class="person">Baron</span>,
belonged to the order of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Augustine, and was prior of the
famous monastery of Inistiogue. On the death of the aged
Bishop Cantwell, Dr. Fitzgerald was advanced to the vacant see,
whilst at the same time he received an apostolic dispensation
permitting him to retain his former priory. He is commemorated
in the papers of the <i>Camera Apostolica</i> as having paid a
portion of the diocesan tax on 10th July, 1528; and from other
sources we learn that he presented to his church a marble altar,
and bequeathed to his successors a pastoral staff of silver. By
one of the usual <em>voluntary surrenders</em> of the 31st year of Henry
<abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> (1540), this good bishop was compelled to hand over
his priory to the agents of the crown. The first to enjoy its
spoils was Sir Richard Butler, but on 20th December, 1551, an
order was issued by the Lords of the Council in England, commanding
it to be given to <span class="person">Edward Seyntloo</span> for twenty-one years,
“in consideration of his painful and diligent services in the late
wars in Ireland” (Morrin, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 255). Nevertheless, in 1567 Queen
Elizabeth ordered it to be again leased to Sir Edmond Butler,
together with the monastery of Connall and the greater part of
the possessions of the Abbey of Baltinglass, and thus were the
offerings of the piety of our fathers sacrilegiously plundered in
<!--Page 568-->
order to gratify the vanity and the pleasures of the retainers of
the crown.</p>

<p>Bishop Milo ruled the see of Ossory till his death in 1550.
From several letters written by the Lord Deputy immediately
after his demise, we learn what little progress had been made by
the so-called reformation in Ossory at this period. For instance,
he thus writes on the 5th of December, <span class="lock">1550:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“And now as touching the bishoprick void (of Ossory), it shall be
well done some honest man be placed therein for the advancement of
religion, which, although it hath been here much talked of these two
or three years past, yet hath it been smally set forth in deed, and
perchance if the disposition of men here were thoroughly known, it
would be thought a thing not easy to be brought to pass”. (Shirley,
<cite>Original Letters</cite>, <abbr title="page">pag.</abbr> 46).</p>

<p>It is not easy to understand how this important see was
allowed to remain vacant for more than two years. As yet no
record has been discovered of a canonically appointed successor
till the accession of Queen Mary. But we feel persuaded that, at
this time, according to the unvarying custom of the Holy See,
such a successor was appointed by Rome. Even the king’s letter
appointing John Bale to the see, is only dated 22nd of October,
1552 (Morrin, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 267). In this letter the king commands the
lord deputy to receive the new bishop as one highly commended;
and yet the order for his consecration was not issued till the 1st
of February following.</p>

<p>Dr. Bale was one of the first founders of the Establishment in
our island: in fact he was for awhile the great pillar of that state
institution, and hence has found many eulogists amongst those
who succeeded him in the enjoyment of its temporalities and
rich benefices. Thus Dr. Mant devotes several pages of his
<cite>History of the Irish Church</cite> (<abbr title="one 220, sequentia">i. 220, seqq.</abbr>) to commend “the
zeal, assiduity, activity, and devotion to the reformed faith in
opposition to the Romish errors”, displayed by this apostle of the
Established Church. It will not, therefore, be uninteresting to
inquire a little into Dr. Bale’s true character, although we do
not reckon him amongst the bishops of this see, that thus, whilst
we await the <em>historical</em> grounds on which Mr. Whiteside <em>promises</em>
to justify that most monstrous institution which ever provoked a
nation’s anathema, we may supply one faithful sketch at least for
the consideration of our readers.</p>

<p>He was born in Suffolk in 1495, and having embraced a
religious life, passed through the various scientific grades in Norwich
and Cambridge. Notwithstanding his solemn vows, he
availed himself of the libertinism which prevailed in 1530, to
take a wife, and adopt the new tenets of the Reformers. He
<!--Page 569-->
himself avowed that <em>a temporal lord</em> was the instrument of his
“conversion”, and Nicholson, in his <cite>Historical Library</cite>, adds,
“that in truth his wife Dorothy had as great a hand in that happy
work as the Lord”. More than once he was threatened with
imprisonment, but he always escaped through the protection of
Lord Cromwell, on whose death he fled from the kingdom and
took refuge in Germany. On the accession of Edward <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr>, he
returned to England, and happening to be presented to the
king in Southampton, received at once a promise of the vacant
bishopric. Bale first arrived from England at Waterford, and
he himself attests that “he was forcibly impressed by the appearance
of the old idolatry”;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_12" id="fnanchor_12"></a><a href="#footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span> that is, he found there a fine devoted
Catholic people, true to the faith of their fathers. His consecration
in Dublin met with great opposition “<em>from the popishly
inclined clergy</em>”, and even the two Irish assistant bishops protested
against the use of the English liturgy on the occasion.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_13" id="fnanchor_13"></a><a href="#footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></span> During
the six months that he held the temporalities, he tells us that he
“enjoyed great peace”, but at the same time both clergy and
people remained devotedly attached to the Catholic faith:
“helpers”, he says, “I found none among my prebendaries and
clergy, but adversaries a great number”. On the accession of
Queen Mary, his episcopal career was quickly brought to a close
in Ossory. “On the 20th day of August”, he writes, “was the
lady Mary with us at Kilkenny proclaimed queen of England,
France, and Ireland, with the greatest solemnity that could be
devised of processions, musters, and disguisings, all the noble
captains and gentlemen thereabout being present. What ado
I had that day with the prebendaries and priests about wearing
the cope, crosier, and mitre in procession, it were too much to
write”. On Thursday, the 31st of August, the clergy and people
of that Catholic city assembled to proclaim their faith: as yet no
statute or proclamation had been made, but they could not brook
any longer delay: “They rang all the bells in that cathedral,
minster, and parish churches”, (writes Bale), “they flung up their
caps to the battlements of the great temple; they brought forth
their copes, candlesticks, holy water stocks, crosses, and censers;
they mustered forth in general procession most gorgeously all
the town over, with <cite>Sancta Maria, ora pro nobis</cite>, and the rest of
the Latin litany”.</p>

<p>Even here, however, the trials of Dr. Bale were not terminated.
A party of the citizens, having at their head an individual
named <span class="person">Barnaby Bolger</span>, surrounded his house, threatening
him with death, unless he ceased to defile by his presence their
Catholic county. It was only by the interposition of the mayor
with four hundred soldiers, that the commotion was partially
<!--Page 570-->
quelled; at night Bale made his escape to Dublin. Instead of
protection, he found that new dangers awaited him in that capital
of our island; in the disguise of a sailor he was again obliged to
seek safety by flight; sailing for Zealand, as <cite>Harris</cite> tells us, he
was taken prisoner at sea, and tried for treason in Cornwall;
escaping thence he sailed for the Continent, but was once more
seized by pirates, and sold as a slave;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_14" id="fnanchor_14"></a><a href="#footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></span> having paid his ransom,
he lived during the following years at Basle and Geneva. On
the accession of Elizabeth he returned to England, but never
sought to be restored to the See of Ossory.</p>

<p>The writings of Bale acquired some celebrity on the continent,
where they were nearly all composed. They are full, however,
of the vilest calumnies against the religious orders and the
Holy See, and are written with characteristic acrimony of style.
Hence Fuller, in his <cite>Catalogue of English Writers</cite>, says:
“Bale knew not how to moderate his passions, and hence deservedly
received the agnomen <cite>Biliosus Balaeus</cite>”. Montacutus
also (in <cite>Apparat.</cite>, <abbr title="Section">§</abbr> 83) styles him, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“impotentis linguae et
calami scriptor”</span>. Pitseus is still more severe, for he thus epitomizes
Bale’s character, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“omnia foedissimus scurra mendaciis et
calumniis replevit”</span>. Andrew Valery, in his preface to the <cite>Bibliotheca
Belgica</cite>, writes, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Joannes Balaeus homo impius quidem,
nominari tamen hoc loco vel ideo potuit ut quis e sordibus
gemmas legat”</span>; and in fine, Gerrard Vossius condemns his bad
faith in treating of the early writers, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“unum scio in priorum
saeculorum scriptoribus non raro Balaei fidem claudicare” (<cite>De
Historicis Latinis</cite>, <abbr title="liber 1 chapter 32, page">lib. i. cap. 32, pag.</abbr> 170)</span>. Such was the
character of this boasted champion of the established church in
our island! But it is time to return to the successors of saint
Canice.</p>

<p>John Thonery, a native of Kilkenny, was nominated to this
see by Queen Mary. The following is the letter of the queen
to the lord-deputy, dated October the 14th, <abbr title="year 1">an. 1ᵒ</abbr> (<i>i. e.</i> <abbr title="year">an.</abbr>
1553):</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Whereas we perceive the bishoprick of Ossory to be void, we
have thought good, for the learning and integrity of life which we
understand to be in John Thonery, bachelor of divinity, to nominate
and appoint him to the same bishoprick: these shall be therefore to
will and command you to make letters-patent under our great seal
to the said John, of the bishoprick, and to give further order for his
consecration and installation, according to the order of our said
realm”.</p>

<p>The congé d’elire to the dean and chapter of the cathedral of
<!--Page 571-->
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Canice was issued on December 26th, and the mandate
for his consecration was given on 31st December, the same year,
(Morrin, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 306). This prelate is described as a benefactor to
his see, and he is especially commended for taking care “to
have the antient charters of his church, which otherwise would
have perished, transcribed and sealed with his seal” (Ware, <abbr title="page">pag.</abbr>
418). Though summoned to Parliament as bishop of Ossory
in the first year of Elizabeth, and receiving commissions from
the crown even in Elizabeth’s reign (Morrin, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 370, 412), the
government found him inflexible in maintaining the Catholic
faith, and consequently declared that his election from the
beginning was void, and that his acts as bishop could not be
valid, since the heretical Bishop Bale was still living.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_15" id="fnanchor_15"></a><a href="#footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></span> In this,
however, the government fathers of the Establishment only gave
another proof of their inconsistency, for a few years before, they
declared that the fact of the flight of Dr. Dowdall rendered
vacant the see of Armagh, and they actually proceeded to the
consecration of Goodacre for that see, though Dowdall was still
living. There is one great advantage, however, which we derive
from the hostile course pursued by the agents of Elizabeth in
regard to Dr. Thonery; it supplies us with the clearest proof we
could desire of his unflinching devotedness to the Church of his
fathers; and when we find Sir W. Cecil, on the 4th July, 1565,
conveying instructions to the lord deputy, that, “Her majesty
understanding that the archbishoprick of Cashel and the bishoprick
of Ossory have been long void, whereby hath grown lack to
the ecclesiastical government there”, would wish to have the sees
united, and one bishop appointed “who might serve as counsellor
there” (Shirley, <cite>Orig. Lett.</cite>, 207), we are more than justified in
concluding that our Catholic bishop was faithful to his trust, and
successfully guarded the flock entrusted to his care against all
the inroads of heresy. He passed to the crown of his zeal and
labours about the year 1567.</p>

<p>The next bishop was <span class="person">Thomas Strange</span> (or <span class="person">Strong</span>), appointed
in consistory of 28th March, 1582. The following is the consistorial
entry:</p>

<p class="quotesig small">“Die 28 Martii, 1582.</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Sua Sanctitas referente Card. Senonensi providit ecclesiae Ossorien.
in Prov. Dubliniensi, a pluribus annis vacanti per obitum
Joannis O’Thonery, in dicta dioecesi defuncti, per Thomam Strong,
Presbyterum Waterfordiensem, Doctorem Theologiae, in curia praesentem”.</p>

<p>In the Vatican list of the Irish clergy in 1579, Dr. Strong is
twice commemorated, first, under the heading of those who
<!--Page 572-->
were pursuing their studies on the Continent we find him described
as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Thomas Strongius, Parisiis, annorum 32”</span>; and again,
under the heading: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Qui sunt in Hibernia fideles operarii vel
certe facile eo transmitti possunt”</span>, we find him thus mentioned
in the fourth place: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“D. Thomas Strong, Waterfordiensis: hic
tenet utramque linguam Anglicanam et Hibernicam sed melius
Anglicam” (<abbr title="From Vatican Archives"><cite>Ex Archiv. Vatic.</cite></abbr>)</span> Immediately after his consecration
he set out for the theatre of his missionary labours; but
it was only “in ruffling apparel with gilt rapier and dagger”,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_16" id="fnanchor_16"></a><a href="#footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></span>
that a bishop could then visit his flock, and so vigilant were the
agents of Elizabeth in his pursuit, that he was soon compelled to
seek refuge in Spain. It is thus the bishop of Killaloe writes on
29th October, 1584:</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Thomas Ossoriensis episcopus mansit in Hibernia aliquot mensibus
in habitu saeculari, tandem contulit se ex Hibernia ad Hispaniam”.</p>

<p>We cannot say with certainty whether Dr. Strange was able
at any time subsequently to return to his see. Whilst in Spain
he devoted himself to the sacred ministry as assistant of the
bishop of Compostella, and he died there (according to the new
computation) on 20th January, 1602. The contemporary,
Malachy Hartry, in his <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Triumphalia Sanctae Crucis</cite>, thus briefly
sketches his career:</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Dum in hac sua patria degisset, Catholicae fidei causâ et ecclesiae
permulta et gravissima a persecutoribus sustulit et in Hispaniam
ire cogitur; Compostellae in Gallicia, demum anno Domini 1601.
Januarii die 20ᵒ obiit atque in claustro Cathedralis Ecclesiae D.
Jacobo consecratae, sub marmoreo lapide, uti vidi cum Strangorum
stemmate inciso, terrae traditur”.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">PETER FRANCIS XAVIER DE RAM.</h3>

<p class="p2">The great question of the present day is the question of
education. The Catholic Church, as the infallible teacher of
men, claims for herself the right to control human thought, and
exercises that right by sitting in judgment on each newfangled
system as it appears. This claim is peremptorily rejected
by the civil power, which, on its part, wishes to make
of education a department of government. The science of the
age sides on the whole with the civil power as against the
Church. Towards the ecclesiastical authorities it assumes at
<!--Page 573-->
times an air of pity, as towards men whose otherwise estimable
qualities are warped by a religious bigotry which is eminently
unscientific; at times it exhibits irritation and distrust; at times
again it is in open and undisguised antagonism. In the face of a
jealous government, to urge, and to urge successfully, the inalienable
rights of the Church, requires no ordinary tact; in the face of
the contempt, or distrust, or antagonism of the intellect of a
country, to take every understanding captive unto Christ, demands
no ordinary courage and ability. And yet this is what is meant
by founding a Catholic University; and this has been achieved
in the nineteenth century in Belgium, under God, through the
instrumentality of one priest, Monsignor Peter Francis Xavier
De Ram, the late Rector of the Catholic University of Louvain.
A life such as his is a model which all may study with great
profit. It is only with his spirit and through his principles that
we may hope to obtain for Ireland what he obtained for Belgium&mdash;the
full liberty of Catholic education.</p>

<p>De Ram’s great work, but not his only work, was the foundation
of the Catholic University of Louvain. At the time when
he was called by the bishops of Belgium to form and direct the
new institution, he was diligently engaged in promoting the
spread of good books, in illustrating the antiquities of his
country, and especially in publishing the lives of the saints and
other distinguished men who have shed glory on his native land.
Almost in his infancy he imbibed a special predilection for the
study of the lives of the saints from a holy aunt, a religious of the
Premonstratensian Order, who lived in his father’s house, having
been driven from her convent at the time of the first French
Revolution. Even before he had completed his clerical studies,
this taste made him publish, as author or editor, several works
bearing on the lives of the saints, and before he was twenty-five
years of age he undertook a new edition in the Flemish language
of the great works on this subject by Alban Butler and Godescard.
This taste he preserved through life, and to it when
fully developed we are indebted for his other great works,
the <cite>Collections of Belgian Synods</cite>, the <cite>Synodicum Belgicum</cite>, the
<cite>Synodicum Antverpiense</cite>, and <cite>Ecclesiastical History of Belgium</cite>,
<cite>Belgica Sacra</cite>, of which he published the plan in 1830, for which
since then he has been collecting most abundant materials, but
which, alas! he has not lived to finish.</p>

<p>Later on, we find him labouring strenuously and successfully to
obtain for the Jesuit Fathers a state subsidy to enable them
to continue the stupendous undertaking of the old Bollandists,
the <cite>Acta Sanctorum</cite>. Thanks in great measure to this help, the
noble work is now making progress to the great glory of God,
to the advantage of religion, and the honour of Belgium. And
<!--Page 574-->
among the first eulogists of the departed prelate, we have the
great Jesuit Father de Buck, the head of the present Bollandists
in Brussels, to whose notice on <abbr title="Monsignor">Mgr.</abbr> de Ram we are indebted
for much that appears in this sketch.</p>

<p>In fine, this same taste for historical research, especially in
the history of his native land, made him take a most distinguished
place in the Royal Academy of Belgium, of which he was for
thirty-one years one of the chief members, and especially in the
Royal Commission of History, founded precisely for the promotion
of the study of the national annals. Indefatigable in his
labours, never-failing in his attendance at the meetings of the
Commission, bringing to them the rich treasures of his learning,
joined to the affability and conciliatory tone which always characterised
him, we are told by one who knew him there, that
never during that long period was there between him and his
associates in that great work the least shadow of a difference.
True to the end to his work for religion and his country, one of
his last public acts, two days before his death, was to assist at a
meeting of the Academy; and he leaves unfinished three works
undertaken in the same holy cause: the Chartulary of the Abbey
of Cambron, the preparation of materials for a general and diplomatic
history of the University of Louvain, and the collection
and arrangement of the short Flemish chronicles scattered in
manuscript through the Belgian libraries, with a view to their
forming a compendium to the great chronicle of De Dynter.</p>

<p>But it is not with De Ram’s historical labours, great as they
were, that we are chiefly interested. His great work for us has
been the Catholic University of Louvain. That university was
proposed by his Holiness Pope Pius <abbr title="Nine">IX.</abbr> as the model which our
bishops were to have in view in founding the Catholic University
of Ireland. Over it De Ram presided for more than thirty
years, in fact since its foundation; the difficulties, seemingly
insuperable, with which he had to contend, were almost identical
with those that press our Irish institution; the means for
overcoming these difficulties in the two countries were very
similar, and we may hope that the Catholic University of Belgium
is but the harbinger of the success of the Catholic University
of Ireland.</p>

<p>The University of Louvain was called into existence to meet
a condition of things, the parallel of which existed in Ireland
in 1850, and to cope with dangers similar to those which, at
that period, impended over the Catholics of this empire. In its
working it has wedded together interests which the sophistry of
the day makes it fashionable to represent as antagonistic. It is
eminently national, eminently scientific, eminently Catholic. It
cultivates literature with a zeal which does not interfere with
<!--Page 575-->
its devotion to theology and other sacred studies, and pursues
even the highest investigations of science in such a way as to
prove that nowhere can freedom of scientific research find a more
congenial home than in a Catholic university. These sentiments
were eloquently expressed by one of the students of the university.
<abbr title="Mister">M.</abbr> Van Tomme, as he stood by the bier of <abbr title="Monsignor">Mgr.</abbr> De
Ram, spoke as follows, in the name of his fellow students who
stood around him:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The great work founded by the Belgian episcopacy has grown
under the shadow of our political and religious independence, and, as
our rector himself expressed it, ‘The university is not only a Catholic
institution, but also a national institution’. Guided by this noble
motto, he directed for thirty-one years the Catholic University,
strengthening each day in our hearts the love of religion and of liberty,
that two-fold foundation on which rests the glory of our past history,
and which guarantees the future of our country. The care of our
souls, the cultivation of our minds, these were the objects most dear
to his heart as a priest; his love for us made him find in us his
reward, his joy, his blessing. How can I express his fatherly tenderness,
his boundless devotedness to our interests, his delicate
management of our national spirit of independence? These were the
principles with which he ruled over this laborious and difficult
work…. You know the blessed fruits produced in the education
of our country by these gifts of mind and heart. Educational liberty,
rescued bleeding from stranger hands, first took refuge in the bosom
of our University, where <abbr title="Monsignor">Mgr.</abbr> De Ram stretched out his arms to
welcome it, and from that day forward watched over it with zealous
care. Our University, the heiress of a glorious name, the offspring
of liberty and of faith, under <abbr title="Monsignor">Mgr.</abbr> De Ram’s presidency,
has nobly bound up together the past and the present. Those great
works urged on with such ardour, the serried phalanx of youths who
have gone forth from this Institution, the eminent men whom this
University has given to our country and to the Church, all proclaim,
that his devoted labours have not been vain, and point out to us unmistakeably
the greatness of the loss sustained on this day by
Catholic youth”.</p>

<p>But we are anticipating the course of events, and we must
take up from the commencement the history of this great man’s
connection with Louvain. We must even go back a little; for,
as Father de Buck remarks, it is only thus we can correct some
erroneous ideas, which have been freely circulated, and form
some notion of the enormous difficulties which surrounded the
foundation of the Catholic University of Belgium. Some of
these erroneous ideas were thus expressed by Sir Robert Kane,
President of the Queen’s College, Cork, in his inaugural address
at the opening of that establishment, on the 7th November,
<span class="lock">1849:&mdash;</span></p>
<!--Page 576-->

<p class="blockquote">“After the revolution, which rendered Belgium an independent
kingdom, the question of university education occupied the attention
of its government as one of the greatest moment. The heads of the
Belgian Church were fully consulted, and they surely deserved to be,
from their right to coöperate in every measure of public welfare.
The result has been the institution of three great colleges: one at
Louvain, formed in the buildings of the old university, and hence
popularly called by the name of the ‘University of Louvain’; the
second college situated at Liege; and the third in Ghent. Students
follow their studies in any of these colleges, but they do not there
get their degrees. What course did the Belgian authorities take,
when, after the Revolution, they had in their own hands the power
of giving to all those colleges a code of securities for faith and morals
which might have served us here as a model? They demanded to
have Louvain absolutely and exclusively under their own control, and
consented to leave the colleges of Liege and Ghent in the hands of
government absolutely, without any provision for moral discipline or
religious instruction. What is the practical result? The College of
Louvain contains only the university faculties, conducted on medieval
models, and educating after the forms of old established universities.
The Colleges of Ghent and Liege contain the practical branches, to
which the majority of the young men attach themselves. The schools
of mines and engineering are at Liege. The schools of mechanics
and of practical chemistry are at Ghent. There are great schools of
medicine at both colleges. Hence the practical education is conducted
at those colleges where there is no religion and no discipline.
In Belgium there are three colleges, one with ultra-ecclesiastical discipline,
attended generally by Catholic foreigners, whom the traditional
fame of the medieval university brings to Louvain. The other
two are colleges without religion, to which the majority of Belgian
students are drawn for practical education” (<cite>Inaugural Address</cite>,
pages 23, 24).</p>

<p>In the course of the notice we shall see how many misstatements
or mistakes are contained in these few sentences. In
this place suffice it to say, that in the year 1864 alone, 325
students of the Catholic University of Louvain took secular
Degrees, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, 117 in Law, 125 in Medicine, 42 in Philosophy
and Letters, and 41 in science; and since 1836, the large number
of 6,881 took Degrees in those Faculties, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, 2,028 in
Law, the same number in Medicine, 1,838 in Philosophy and
Letters, and 987 in Science. We have taken these figures from
the official publication, <cite>l’Annuaire</cite>, or University Calendar, for
1865, and from it we also learn, that of 768 students, the total
number in the university in the Session 1863-64, only 121
were Students of Theology. There were in the Faculty of
Law 204, in that of Medicine 230, in that of Philosophy and
Letters 102, and in that of Science 111.</p>

<p>The true history of the circumstances, which preceded and
<!--Page 577-->
accompanied the foundation of the Catholic University of Louvain,
may be briefly told, as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>By the treaty of Vienna in 1815, the Catholic and Protestant
Netherlands, Belgium and Holland, were united under one king,
William <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> of the House of Orange. Immediately on his accession
this monarch proposed for the acceptance of his whole kingdom
a constitution which had been originally intended for
Protestant Holland only. This constitution was condemned as
anti-Catholic by the ordinaries of all the dioceses of Belgium.
It was also rejected by the nobles or other chief men of the state.
But it is worthy of remark, that, notwithstanding its condemnation
by the bishops, only 126 voters out of 1325 alleged the
attacks on the Church as the motive of their rejection of the
constitution; and although 766 opposed it, 527 were found to
support this most obnoxious portion of it. From this fact we see
the great strength of uncatholic opinion in Belgium fifty years
ago, since in so large a number of the chief men of the nation, so
few were found to follow the teachings of their bishops.</p>

<p>The ten years which followed were spent by the king, William
<abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, in endeavouring to undermine and still more weaken the
Catholic and national feeling in Belgium&mdash;to mould that country
and Holland into one nationality, which would be animated by
one spirit, and that spirit Dutch, and consequently Protestant.
For this purpose Dutch was made the official language for all
administrative purposes and in all the courts of law and other
legal transactions. The immediate result of this measure was to
throw the education of the greater part of the Belgian youth into
the hands of Dutchmen, and Dutchmen were also placed in
every post of honour and emolument throughout the kingdom.</p>

<p>At length, on the 14th of June, 1825, two royal decrees were
published, by which it was sought to transfer to the hands of the
Protestant Government of Holland the education of the whole of
the youth of all classes in Catholic Belgium. The chief provisions
of the first of these decrees were as follow:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Whereas many schools and institutions for the teaching of the
Latin and Greek languages; and for the training of youth for the
ecclesiastical state, as well as for other professions, have been established
without our consent; and whereas Article 226 of the Fundamental
Law<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_17" id="fnanchor_17"></a><a href="#footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></span> has given us the charge of public instruction …
desiring at the same time to facilitate and favour every arrangement
by which young men may be fitted to become well educated ecclesiastics
for the Roman Catholic Church,… we have decreed
and do hereby decree….</p>

<p class="blockquote">“<abbr title="Article">Art.</abbr> 2. No Latin school, college, or athenaeum, shall be established
<!--Page 578-->
without the express authorisation of the Department of the
Interior.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“<abbr title="Article">Art.</abbr> 3. No one shall teach the Latin and Greek languages <em>to the
children of more than one family at once</em>, either in primary schools or
in private houses, without having first obtained in one of the universities
of the kingdom the degree of <i>candidat</i> or of <i>Docteur en
Lettres</i>.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“<abbr title="Article">Art.</abbr> 4. All colleges, athenaeums, or Latin schools, are placed
under the control of the Department of the Interior.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“All colleges, athenaeums, or Latin schools, named in <abbr title="Article">Art.</abbr> 1,
which at the date of this decree have not been approved as such by
former decrees, <em>shall be closed at the end of the month of September</em>,
1825, unless sanctioned before that time”.</p>

<p>By the second royal decree a “Philosophical College” was
established in Louvain for aspirants to the priesthood.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Whereas some of the heads of the clergy have represented to us
that the preparatory education given to young men intended for the
ecclesiastical state is insufficient, and whereas we are desirous of providing
means to form able ecclesiastics for the Roman Catholic Church.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“<abbr title="Article">Art.</abbr> 1. An establishment for the preparatory education of young
Roman Catholics aspiring to the ecclesiastical state, shall be provisorily
erected at one of the universities in the northern provinces of
the kingdom. This establishment, under the title of ‘Philosophical
College’, shall be installed in a suitable building…. The
students shall be received therein, with permission to wear the ecclesiastical
habit.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“<abbr title="Article">Art.</abbr> 14, After the space of two years, to be counted from the
opening of the ‘Philosophical College’, no philosophical lectures
shall be given in the episcopal seminaries…. After the
same time no student shall be admitted into the seminaries who shall
not have duly completed his course of studies in the ‘Philosophical
College’. Each student of the same college must spend therein two
years at least”.</p>

<p>Thus did the Protestant King of the Netherlands think he
had secured the undisputed control of the education, ecclesiastical
and lay, of his Belgian subjects; but a very short time
sufficed to convince him of his mistake. In vain was the short
delay of two years allowed by these decrees of June 14th, refused
by a subsequent enactment of the 11th July, which strictly
forbade any student to be received from that day forward into
any episcopal seminary in Belgium, unless he had completed his
preparatory studies in the Philosophical College. In vain, by
another decree of the 14th of August following, the youth of
Belgium were forbidden to seek abroad the free Catholic education
denied to them at home, and unless educated in one of
the state institutions, declared incapable of holding any public
<!--Page 579-->
office in the gift of the government, or exercising any ecclesiastical
function within the kingdom. In vain, by a decree of
the 20th November, were the superiors of the diocesan seminaries
ordered to dismiss forthwith all youths received since the
previous 11th of July; and the young men themselves also commanded
to withdraw. On the other hand, in vain was all
the influence of the government used to induce the bishops to
approve, or at least tolerate, the new system. In vain was it
sought to convince the Common Father of the Faithful that the
Philosophical College was unexceptionable, by sending to His
Holiness’ own seminary in Rome some youths of exemplary life,
who might, by their good conduct, belie the condemnation pronounced
against the institution where they had made their early
studies. The episcopacy of Belgium continued firm in its opposition,
and the Sovereign Pontiff, Pope Leo <abbr title="Twelve">XII.</abbr>, directed his
internuncio at the Hague to explain that it was impossible for
the head of the Catholic Church to assent to measures destructive
to the liberties of Catholics, or even to abstain from condemning
them and protesting against them. The Belgian youths
would not go to the Philosophical College; the few who went
would not be admitted to Holy Orders by the bishops; and four
years passed slowly along in passive opposition to the inroads of
the government on Catholic education.</p>

<p>At last, on the 20th of June, 1829, the Dutch Government
had to acknowledge itself vanquished. A decree was published
abrogating so much of the legislation of 1825 as rendered attendance
at the Philosophical College obligatory.</p>

<p>But along with this concession, and perhaps as it were to
neutralize it, came new attacks in other ways on the liberties of
Catholic Belgium. The royal message to the States-General at
the beginning of 1830, recommended measures tending to a
further <em>unification</em> of Belgium with Holland. Event followed
event, and before the end of August a revolution broke out,
and five of the best men in Belgium were installed at Brussels
as a provisional government, under the presidency of the Baron
de Gerlache, now head of the Society of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Vincent de Paul,
and president also of the recent Catholic congresses at Mechlin.</p>

<p>When the revolution broke out in 1830, the wisest members
of the clergy said, as Father de Buck tells us, “<cite>Fieri non debuit,
sed factum valet</cite>”, and the whole of the priesthood made common
cause with the people. But, although the great masses of the
country people remained faithful to Catholic principles, and
although the nobility was returning to the practices of religion;
although the persecution of the clergy by the Dutch Government
had aroused the spirit of the nation, and several even of the
infidel party began to lay aside their prejudices, and to express
<!--Page 580-->
sympathy for the faithful priesthood of their common country,
still the religious position of Belgium at that moment was most
unsatisfactory.</p>

<p><abbr title="Monsignor">Mgr.</abbr> Van Bommel, Bishop of Liege, tells us, that “in
1838 there were in Belgium about 100,000 pseudo-liberals,
deadly enemies of the Catholic Church, and most powerful”.
“And it is not hard”, continues the learned prelate, “to explain
the fact. For more than forty years all who are destined
to occupy positions of importance were, in general, brought
up without religious principles. Under the late government the
religious element had no part in university teaching; a part of
this teaching had even been entrusted to men known to profess
anti-religious principles. The wicked passions of men, dangerous
occasions, bad example, an immoral theatre, and above all,
a literature steeped in wickedness or hostile to Catholic principles;&mdash;in
fine, the repeated declarations of men who, for party purposes,
told the rising generation that to it alone should henceforth
belong the rights of government&mdash;all resulted in raising this
young generation to such a pitch of pride, independence, and
licentiousness, that the sweet yoke of faith and the practices of
religion became insupportable. Thus was there formed, outside
of the masses, who remained faithful, a multitude of men of
position and of influence, who know the religion of their fathers
only from the bad books where it is attacked, from the stage
where it is insulted, from the assemblies where its sacred ministers
are ridiculed, from the newspapers where it is calumniated”.</p>

<p>Such was the religious position of Belgium when the Belgian
episcopacy determined to found the Catholic University of
Louvain. Public functionaries, barristers, physicians, merchants,
manufacturers, nearly all the men of influence in the country,
were infected with that false liberalism which, as <abbr title="Monsignor">Mgr.</abbr> de Ram
himself declared in November, 1830, made many who cried out
most loudly for liberty, intend to use it only for self-aggrandisement
and at the expense of Catholicity.</p>

<p>The prospect was uninviting; but the bishops were not to
be daunted, although in February, 1834, on their publishing
their decree establishing the university, there were disturbances
in Brussels and in nearly all the episcopal cities. In December,
1833, they had obtained from Pope Gregory <abbr title="Sixteen">XVI.</abbr>
the sanction of their project and an apostolic brief for erecting
the new university; and in June, 1834, they published in another
meeting the general statutes for its government. On the same
occasion the assembled prelates decided that the youthful <abbr title="Mister">M.</abbr> de
Ram&mdash;he had not yet completed his thirtieth year, and was then
a canon of the Metropolitan Church of Mechlin, and professor of
canon law and church history in the seminary of that diocese&mdash;should
<!--Page 581-->
occupy a distinguished place in the new institution. He
was formally appointed, within the next few months, head of
the Catholic University of Belgium, with the title which in past
ages appertained to that office&mdash;<cite>Rector Magnificus</cite>, and in that
capacity assisted at the solemn inauguration of the university in
the Cathedral of Mechlin, on the 4th of November of the same
year, 1834.</p>

<p>No sooner was he appointed to his high office than he set
about finding professors for the faculties of theology, of science,
and of philosophy and letters, which alone were to be opened
the first year in the temporary home of the university in
Mechlin. All the priests he selected were Belgians. Of the
lay professors one was a Belgian, the rest were Dutch, French,
Germans, and Danes. The following year the university was
transferred to Louvain, and we have the formal act of agreement
entered into in October, 1835, between Monsignor de
Ram and the burgomaster of the city of Louvain, and afterwards
solemnly approved by the bishops and municipality, by which
on the one hand the bishops undertake to establish a full university
course, and on the other hand the town council “undertakes
to give gratuitously to the University the free use of the buildings
<em>des Halles</em> (the great university lecture halls and other public
buildings) <em>du Collège du Pape, du Collège des Vétérans, du
Collège du Roi, du Collège des Prémontres, du Collège de Saint
Esprit, et du Theâtre Anatomique</em>”. <abbr title="Monsignor">Mgr.</abbr> de Ram had now to
organise the faculties of law and of medicine, and here his difficulties
increased. Where was he to find professors in whom faith
and true Catholic principles were united with that profound and
varied learning which would fit them to occupy chairs in the new
university? When we consider the deplorable state of Catholic
education among the cultivated classes in Belgium at the time we
speak of, these difficulties can be better imagined than expressed;
and from these difficulties we may form a judgment of the great
prudence and consummate wisdom through which Monsignor
de Ram raised the institution to that proud eminence which is now
enjoyed by her professors among the learned bodies of Europe.
In all her faculties there are among the professors not only men
of extraordinary learning, who unite clearness and method with
depth and extent of knowledge, but also models of every Christian
virtue; so that with good reason does F. de Buck conclude this
portion of his notice of the illustrious prelate by exclaiming:
“Yes, the professorial staff brought together by <abbr title="Monsignor">Mgr.</abbr> de Ram,
and which can henceforth be easily recruited from amongst the
students of the university itself, is the chief glory, the undying
crown of his rectorship”. But to understand the relations of
<abbr title="Monsignor">Mgr.</abbr> de Ram with the professorial staff of the university, we
<!--Page 582-->
should read the funeral discourses which he pronounced at the
obsequies of those who preceded him in death. They are published
in the University Calendars from 1838 to this time, and
clearly prove the esteem and affection he bore to all who were
united with him in the great work of his life, the care with
which he selected them, the zeal with which he promoted the
honour and happiness of each, and the sincere joy with which
he was filled when well-merited success crowned their literary or
scientific labours.</p>

<p>His devotedness to the students of the University was not less
than his affectionate esteem for the professors. By every means
in his power he sought to promote their spiritual, their intellectual,
and even their temporal interests. And this anxiety for
the welfare of the youth entrusted to him was not confined to
the time they spent in the university; it followed them into after
life. “His fatherly solicitude”, says <abbr title="Mister">M.</abbr> Prosper Staes, of the
Brussels bar, formerly a student of the university, “his fatherly
solicitude was not limited to the youths who gathered round
him each year for the purposes of study. It followed the
students in their several careers through life. His old students
always found in their rector one to encourage them, to counsel
them, to gather them about him, as a father gathers his children,
to rejoice in their success&mdash;in a word, to make them his joy and
his delight”.</p>

<p>His feelings towards the students, and theirs to him, as well
as the sentiments with which he unceasingly sought to fill their
minds, can well be gathered from the touching words pronounced
over his lifeless remains by one of the law students of the university,
<abbr title="Mister">M.</abbr> Van Tomme:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“To-day on this solemn occasion, the remembrance of the twenty-fifth
anniversary of our university, fills us with sentiments of deep
emotion. Surrounded by the multitude of your students whom you
loved so much, happy in being one heart and one soul with them,
you then said: Ever remember our watch-word: God and our
country; this word epitomizes our duties and our principles. Yes;
we have taken to ourselves this word as our inheritance. It will be
our comfort in this moment of sorrow, as in those days of joy it
excited our enthusiasm. Wherever our students are called by duty,
this noble thought will always be their motto, as it is to-day their
hope.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“<span class="sc">God</span>, the knowledge of whom you have imparted to us so well,
to whom your life of merit, hidden to men’s eyes, is manifest for
your recompense.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“And <span class="sc lowercase">OUR COUNTRY</span>, which in the persons of these numbers of
youths whom you have educated for her, and filled with your spirit,
will ever bear upon her the impress of the works you have achieved,
and veneration for your memory”.</p>

<!--Page 583-->
<p>We are told, that in his government of the students, he knew
how to follow the <i>via media</i> between severity and too great
indulgence. He was sometimes blamed for excess in the latter
direction; but those who make this accusation seem to forget
that he had to do with the direction, not of an ecclesiastical
seminary, nor even of a school or college, but of an university,
where young men were to be prepared, not for the service of the
sanctuary, but for the busy scenes of life, and where opening
manhood, freed from the restraints of boyhood, was to be
gently led rather than forced, to love the beautiful paths of
wisdom on account of their beauty, and to walk steadily in them,
because of the goal to which they lead. If he did not hinder
everything that is evil, he is not to be blamed; for no legislator
can ever aim at this; and we are told by the Incarnate Wisdom
Himself, that the cockle must at times be permitted to grow with
the wheat, lest in plucking it up, the good grain should be injured.
But that his work produced blessed fruits, and that those fruits
are likely to remain, is evident to every one who compares the
state of religious education among Belgian Catholics when it was
founded, with its state at present. He did everything in his
power to preserve and strengthen the spirit and practice of
religion among the students. He established a regular course
of religious instruction, at which all the students of philosophy
are obliged to assist, and to which the other students are invited;
twice each year he brought the most distinguished preachers to
Louvain to deliver religious conferences, which might serve as a
preparation for the Paschal communion; he assisted in establishing
in the University branches, or conferences of the Society
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Vincent de Paul, and to the utmost of his power encouraged
the Sodality or Congregation of the Blessed Virgin,
which was founded by the Jesuit Fathers in the chapel of their
residence, and numbers over two hundred members, all lay
students of the Catholic University.</p>

<p>What have been the results? At the beginning of this article
we saw the deplorable state of educated Catholics in Belgium in
1830, with respect to Catholic feelings and principles. At that
time the number of Catholic barristers and physicians who practised
their religion was extremely small. Now, in Brussels,
Liege, and Ghent, the greater part of the young bar, if not of
the whole bar practising in the chief courts of law, which are
situated in these three cities, are thoroughly devoted to the
Catholic Church. Without doubt, several of these young lawyers
did not study in Louvain; they owe the preservation of their
faith to the good education received in the bosom of their families,
in the Jesuit Colleges, and in other Catholic institutions; but a
large number has studied in the Catholic University, and all of
<!--Page 584-->
them must be greatly confirmed in their religious feelings and
principles, and must derive new strength and courage to declare
them openly, from the public spirit redolent of Catholicity which
proceeds from Louvain. We are told that one of the most interesting
features of the great Catholic Congress of Malines in 1863,
was the presence of eight hundred students of the University of
Louvain, youths as distinguished for learning as for the truly
Catholic spirit by which they were animated on that most interesting
occasion. We are also told, that in all the great cities,
and some of the smaller towns of Belgium, literary societies are
springing up, which publicly proclaim the Catholic principles on
which they are founded; and that the class in Belgium most
devoted to the interests of religion, is precisely the educated
Catholic youth of the country. What wonder, then, that the
immense influence for good exercised by the University of
Louvain, under the presidency of its distinguished rector, should
be acknowledged in Belgium by enemies as well as friends, and
that on more occasions than one the Holy See itself should have
exhorted the bishops of other countries, as well as of Ireland, to
imitate their brethren of Belgium by founding a Catholic University
like that of Louvain!</p>

<p>While labouring to make the youth of the University good
Christians, <abbr title="Monsignor">Mgr.</abbr> de Ram laboured also with indefatigable zeal to
make them learned men and good citizens. <span class="sc">Faith, Learning,
Liberty</span>, were the words which he loved to unite in his discourses.
Every one knows the results of his inculcating those
principles without ceasing on the young Belgians entrusted to
him by his Catholic country, which had just recovered its
liberty from Protestant Holland; and the numerous and high
distinctions won by the students of Louvain, in the public examinations
to which the whole youth of Belgium is admissible,
attest the excellence of the literary and scientific teaching of the
University, while the elevated positions now occupied by many
of its ancient alumni prove beyond gainsaying, that its educational
fruits remain, and will be an abundant source of intellectual,
social, and political blessings to Belgium.</p>

<p>Such is the institution which has just lost its first rector, we
may say its founder. Such the work which <abbr title="Monsignor">Mgr.</abbr> de Ram
directed with consummate wisdom for thirty-one years. Such
the Catholic University of which Belgium, nay Christendom,
may well be proud. It is a great lesson to us all to see that even
in these days of mere material progress, without faith, without
Christian love&mdash;when men would fain persuade us that learning,
to be a blessing, need not be referred to God or religion&mdash;when
the apostle’s words: “<cite>Scientia inflat, charitas vero aedificat</cite>”,
are held to be not over true. An University founded and
<!--Page 585-->
governed by a Catholic episcopacy, by the aid of their Catholic
people only, established on purely Catholic principles, without
any of those helps which men of the world value most, already
in its infancy rivals the great seats of learning of the middle
ages. And all this is due in a great measure to one man, who
at thirty years of age was called by the Belgian Episcopacy
to rule over it, and who, with untiring energy, consummate wisdom,
and gentle perseverance, moulded every part into perfect
symmetry, so that schismatical Russia came to study the model,
and the Holy See could say to Ireland, as well as to any other
country wishing for a Catholic University: “<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Inspice, et fac
secundum exemplar</cite>”. With no more fitting words can we conclude
this brief notice, than with those spoken by the Vice-Rector
of the University at his funeral: “The Catholic University
of Louvain was indebted to God and to the bishops of
Belgium for her Rector: to her Rector she owes everything
else”.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_18" id="fnanchor_18"></a><a href="#footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="h3head">LITURGICAL QUESTIONS.</h3>

<p class="p2">A reverend correspondent has taken occasion from our remarks
in the last number of the <cite>Record</cite>, to ask a question about the
custom prevalent in Ireland of reciting the <cite>De profundis</cite> after
mass. We will quote his own words: “In reading the liturgical
questions in your last number of the <cite>Record</cite>, it occurred to me
to inquire on what authority is founded the practice of reciting
the <cite>De profundis</cite> after mass, whether it can be omitted <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad
libitum, secluso scandalo</i>, and whether it should be said at the
altar, or when the priest descends, or when going into the
sacristy”. The practice of reciting the <cite>De Profundis</cite> after each
low mass, we believe, exists in all Ireland, without any exception
<!--Page 586-->
of diocese or district, and has existed for a long period. It is the
opinion of many well versed in Irish ecclesiastical matters, that
it was introduced and authorised by the Holy See as a substitute
for the numerous masses and suffrages for which innumerable
endowments were founded by the piety of the faithful in former
times, and which were taken away from the Catholic Church at
the time of the Reformation. It is more than probable that a
rescript from the Holy See authorised this practice, in order that
the pious intentions of the founders of such endowments might
not altogether be frustrated by the rapacity of the reformers. It is
difficult to understand how, under other circumstances, the practice
could have become so universal in Ireland. Indeed we have
heard it remarked, that possibly a rescript of an old date bearing
on this subject might be found; and if any of our readers could
aid us in getting authentic documents on the matter, we need
scarcely say how anxious we would be to insert them or any
information connected with this subject in the <cite>Record</cite>. While
writing these lines we have been informed that in the Irish College,
Paris, there is a rescript authorising the recital of the <cite>De
profundis</cite> after the community mass in the college.</p>

<p>Apart, however, from this consideration we may reply that
the recital of the <cite>De profundis</cite> cannot be omitted <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad libitum</i>.
Whatever may have been its origin, it has become a usage with
the force of law, against which no individual is at liberty to act.
Even if the Holy See did not authorise the practice in the commencement,
it must necessarily have been introduced by the
bishops of the day, and its continuance for so long a period
throughout the entire Irish Church without any reclamation from
ecclesiastical authority, would be quite sufficient to show that all
should conform to such a practice, which in itself is so holy and
useful, and calculated to confer such advantages on the suffering
souls in Purgatory.</p>

<p>We are therefore clearly of opinion that no priest can on
principle omit the <cite>De profundis</cite>, and we would take the
liberty of reminding him of the munificent endowments established
in former ages of the Irish Church for the exclusive object
of having Requiem Masses said, and securing the suffrages
of the faithful in aid of the suffering souls in Purgatory. We
would refer our readers, for information on this point, to Dr.
Lanigan’s <cite>Ecclesiastical History of Ireland</cite>, <abbr title="volume three chapter">vol. iii. chap.</abbr> 21.</p>

<p>With regard to the proper time for saying the <cite>De profundis</cite>, we
think that the practice of saying it at the foot of the altar is the
most correct. We know this to be the course adopted by many
priests, who descend from the altar, make a genuflexion or a
reverence to the altar, and then standing recite the <cite>De profundis</cite>.
By this plan it is made manifest that the <cite>De profundis</cite> is a thing
<!--Page 587-->
quite distinct from the Mass, and not appertaining to it. However,
it is right to say that nothing decisive can be laid down as
to the place and time of reciting it. There is a decree of the
Sacred Congregation of Rites given by Merati in his <cite>Series Decretorum</cite>,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 436, which is as follows:</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quando adest legatum quod sacerdos antequam discedat ab altari,
recitet aliquod Evangelium, Psalmum, seu orationem post terminatam
missam, debet oneri sibi injuncto satisfacere post finem missae exutis
vestibus sacerdotalibus et cum sola cotta in altari vel in sacristia
et sic legatum adimplere S. R. C., 31 Augusti, 1669, in Conversanen”.</p>

<p>These words would appear to imply that in our case the sacred
vestments should be taken off. However, on referring to the
decree itself in Gardellini, we find its terms are not so comprehensive
as the interpretation of Merati would make them. The
following are the words:</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“2339. Conversan. Capitulum Collegiatae Rosigliani Dioecesis
Conversanensis exposuit in S. R. C. Nicolaum <i>Franciscium in ejus
sub quo decessit testamento</i>, reliquisse ejus bona dicto capitulo
cum onere celebrandi Missam quotidianam et singulis diebus veneris
de Passione et cum onere, terminata missa post Evangelium in principio
erat verbum, etc., recitandi ipsam Passionem secundum Johannem.
Et proinde cum dicta dispositio sit contra Ritus Ecclesiasticos supplicavit
pro declaratione. An dicta passio recitanda sit post dictum
Evangelium alibi per celebrantem?</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Et S. eadem C. censuit: Recitandam esse post finem missae exutis
vestibus sacerdotalibus et cum sola cotta in altari vel in sacristia.
Hac die 31 Augusti, 1669”.</p>

<p>The words of this decree do not refer to a psalm or prayer, but
simply to the passion of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John, and hence, as far as our question
is concerned, no conclusion can be clearly established except by
analogy, and by whatever weight may attach to the authority of
Merati, who manifestly thus extends the meaning of the decree.
After writing these lines, we have learned from a distinguished
ecclesiastic, that there exists a Rescript of the Holy See about
the recital of the <cite>De profundis</cite> in Ireland after Mass. He has
kindly promised to procure it for a future number of the <cite>Record</cite>,
when we shall gladly insert it.</p>

<p>The same reverend correspondent calls our attention to another
matter which indeed is of very great importance, and on which
we shall make a few remarks. Our correspondent says, that the
altar bread used in this country is of a very inferior kind, and
not elegant, and that it leaves on the corporal many fragments.
If this be the case in some parts of the country, it is unnecessary
to say that it is a matter of such importance that immediate
<!--Page 588-->
attention should be called to it by the parish priests or the superiors
of the different churches. As far as we are aware, we have
no grounds for complaint on this head, as generally speaking
the breads are made in this city with care and neatness and very
few fragments fall from them. It is quite possible, however, that in
some districts sufficient care may not be bestowed on this
matter, and the breads may not be made with that care
which the majesty of the great Sacrifice demands. We have
heard from persons competent to give an opinion on the subject,
that in some districts abuses have crept in; for instance, when the
superior of a church, personally responsible for the due observance
of the rubrics concerning the Holy Sacrifice, leaves to a
servant the making and cutting of the breads for the use of
the altar. In such cases there is great danger that through
carelessness or negligence they will not be properly made.
The cutters or the machines for making them in the course of
time will become impaired and quite unfit for their purpose,
and a mere servant may not try to remedy the evil. For
this reason, we would strongly recommend all concerned to
engage some community of nuns or others well versed in such
matters, and who at the same time fully understand the importance
of what they are engaged in, to make the altar
breads. We have ourselves examined the altar breads made
by various communities, and seldom had we any reason to find
fault, except in some instances when the large altar breads appeared
to us to be too thick.</p>

<p>This suggestion, we think, will meet our reverend correspondent’s
question as to the improvements that may be made in connection
with this matter.</p>

<p>He then proceeds: “It may be observed here that the cutters
too are of no regular size. They are generally over small. I
have seen breads no larger than a sixpence intended for communicating
the faithful. In the distribution of such very small
particles there is evidently danger of irreverence”. No one can
question the truth of what our correspondent states; but we
must say that we have generally found the breads sufficiently large
when made by the convents or others duly charged with so important
a matter, and we may also remark that the cutters will
not be made too small if there be no demand for them on the
part of the clergy. The small breads ought to be considerably
larger than a shilling and very little under a two-shilling
piece.</p>

<p>We are much obliged to our reverend correspondent for calling
our attention to this matter, and we hope the observations which
we have taken the liberty of making, will have the effect of correcting
any abuses that may exist, and inducing all persons concerned
<!--Page 589-->
to provide themselves with cutters of a proper size, or
what would be still better, to secure the services of a religious
community, or of others duly authorized to prepare the breads
for the use of the altar.</p>

<p>We shall close these observations by giving some extracts on
the present subject, from a very useful book published at Louvain,
by <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> P. J. F. De Herdt, entitled <cite>Sacrae Liturgiae
Praxis</cite>, which is very highly esteemed.</p>

<p class="hanging">DUBIA CIRCA MISSARUM ITERATIONEM, APPLICATIONEM
MISSAE PRO POPULO, ET RECEPTIONEM
ELEEMOSYNAE.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ex S. Congregatione Concilii Tridentini Interpretum.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc lowercase">VISITATIONIS SS. LIMINUM.</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_19" id="fnanchor_19"></a><a href="#footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Compendium Facti.</i>&mdash;Episcopus A in relatione status suae Dioecesis
ad S. Sedem transmissa, haec exposuit: “Ducentae circiter Paroeciae,
in hac Dioecesi extant, quae aliam filialem sibi adnexam habent, in
qua Parochus diebus dominicis et festis per annum, secundam Missam
celebrat: et circa hanc consuetudinem, diversa dubia, suboriuntur
super quibus declarationem necessariam a S. Congregatione humiliter
expostulo. Et primum animadvertere debeo, quod fidelium numerus
iuxta has ecclesias commorantium, valde varius est: in aliquibus
sunt quinque vel decem, in aliis ducenti, imo et sexcenti. Distantia
a matrice, modo ad milliarium non attingit, modo sunt duo, tria, aut
quatuor milliaria. Valde difficile foret etiam post exquisitam investigationem
definire utrum hae ecclesiae nunc filiales, fuerint aliquando
ecclesiae matrices, seu verae paroeciae”. Quatuor proinde dubia proponebat
S. Concilii Congregationi, quae antequam solverentur, rogatus
est Episcopus, ut magis praecise referret de omnimoda deficientia
Sacerdotum, ac mediorum quibus per alium celebrari posset in filialibus
ecclesiis; et utrum ecclesiae modo filiales nuncupatae, dotem aliquam
seu congruam, distinctam a matrice haberent, perquisitis actis
Curiae, ac SS. Visitationum. At, quae relata sunt, sufficientia non
erant ad integram quaestionem singillatim definiendam, quae ingentem
paroeciarum numerum complectebatur. Relatum enim est de
magna et generica presbiterorum deficientia, eorumque redituum
paupertate, qui dum prius ex decimis alebantur; deinde, his subtractis,
assignata est pro quolibet parocho, certa pensio, independenter
omnino a populorum numero, vel parochiarum quas quilibet regit.
Concinnata itaque hac ratione fuerunt proposita ab Episcopo dubia.</p>

<p><abbr title="1">I.</abbr> “Utrum haec consuetudo secundam Missam celebrandi, toleranda
sit in omnibus praedictis ecclesiis adnexis, ubi hic mos ita invaluit,
ut populus etiam ius ad illam exigendam existimet se habere”.</p>

<p><abbr title="2">II.</abbr> “Utrum Parochus necessario debeat illam secundam Missam
applicare pro Populo sicuti primam, vel liberam retineat illius applicationem
cum stipendio”.</p>

<p><abbr title="3">III.</abbr> “Utrum licentiam dare queat Episcopus ad illam secundam
Missam celebrandam in casibus similibus, et in locis ubi talis consuetudo
usque adhuc non invaluit”.</p>

<p><abbr title="4">IV.</abbr> “Utrum praesertim praedictam licentiam concedere possit tempore
<!--Page 0591-->
collectionis messium, cum plurimi operarii in uno praedio seu
villa concurrant, qui certe missam non audirent, nisi Parochus secundam
in eo loco diceret, ex eo quod alius Sacerdos ad illam dicendam
haberi non possit”.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc lowercase">DISCEPTATIO SYNOPTICA.</span></p>

<p><i>Quoad missae iterationem.</i>&mdash;Ex officio, haec praecipua capita iuris
proponebantur S. Congregationi. Praemissa nempe notione historica
disciplinae quae successive hanc missarum iterationem moderata est,
allegabatur caput 3 <i>de celebrat. missar.</i> in quo ita sanxit Innocentius
<abbr title="3">III.</abbr> “Excepto die Nativitatis Dominicae nisi causa necessitatis suadeat,
sufficit Sacerdoti semel in die unam Missam solummodo celebrare”.
Ubi verbum sufficit, non convenientiam aliquam commendat,
sed veram praeceptum continet, ceu etiam docuit Benedict. XIV. in
<cite>Const. Declarasti nobis</cite>. Quaenam porro debeat esse necessitas ab Innocentio
indicata, licet disputaverint de ea Doctores, hodie, praesertim
post hanc Benedicti <abbr title="14">XIV.</abbr> Constitutionem, illa est (subiungebatur)
qua reperitur presbiter qui duas habeat paroecias, et in alterutram
nequeat Populus convenire, nec alius habeatur presbiter praeter
Parochum, qui missam possit celebrare. Et similis reputatur etiam
casus quo Parochus etsi non praesit duabus paroeciis, tamen vel duos
regat inter se dissitos populos, quorum unus ob magnam locorum distantiam,
assistere non possit Parocho celebranti, vel etiam si una sit
Ecclesia, quae universum Populum simul capere non possit. Extra
huiusmodi necessitatis casus, neque consuetudo, etsi vetustissima suffragari
potest Missarum iterationi, ut S. C. C. in <cite>Dertusen 20 Augusti
1768</cite>, et alibi censuit. Adnotabatur vero <em>in facto</em> quod licet haberetur
generica presbiterorum deficientia, tamen ex ea argui non poterat
vera necessitas in qualibet paroecia.</p>

<p>Caeterum observabatur, distantiam Ecclesiarum quae filiales nuncupabantur,
a Parochiali Ecclesia, ab uno circiter lapide, usque ad
tria et quatuor passuum millia protendi: et fideles in multis Ecclesiis
usque ad biscentum et sexcentum ascendere, quamvis in nonnullis,
non nisi quinque vel decem tantum, reperiantur. Ob quas peculiares
circumstantias, exponebatur responsio S. C. in casu non absimili,
proposito per <cite>Summaria precum die 12 Ianuarii 1847 in Lingonen</cite>. In
eo enim pariter agebatur <abbr title="1">I.</abbr> de consuetudine qua nonnulli animarum
Pastores, Missam iterabant eodem die; et aderat <abbr title="2">II.</abbr> quaedam Communitas,
uno circiter lapide, a Parochiali Ecclesia separata, constans
viginti circiter personis. Et S. C. respondit: “Scribatur Episcopo
ut concedat bis Missam celebrandi licentiam, quatenus eae circumstantiae,
et praecisae necessitatis casus concurrant, quos Benedict.
XIV. in sua Const. <i>Declarasti nobis</i> requirit; in casu vero quem idem
orator proponit, (seu in secundo casu) licentiam esse concedendam”.</p>

<p><i>Quando applicanda non est secunda missa pro populo.</i>&mdash;Quod attinet
vero ad applicationem secundae Missae pro populo, afferebatur Resolutio
S. C. C. in <cite>Lucen. applicationis Missarum 12 Martii 1774</cite> in qua
proposito dubio: “An Parochi duabus Ecclesiis parochialibus praepositi,
teneantur Dominicis, aliisque Festis diebus, Missam in unaquaque
Ecclesia sive per se sive per alios applicare pro populo in casu” responsum
<!--Page 592-->
prodiit: <i>Affirmative, exceptis tantum parochiis unitis, unione plenaria
et extinctiva, et scribatur Episcopo iuxta instructionem.</i> Instructio
vero continebat: S. Congregationem <i>nunquam dubitasse, quod Parochi
teneantur applicationi supradictae Missae pro populo singulis diebus
Dominicis, et Festis in unaquaque ex Ecclesiis Parochialibus quae vel
aeque principaliter, vel subiective coniunctae sunt, atque incorporatae; cum
applicatio unius tantummodo Missae pro populo, locum habeat in iis
parochialibus quae invicem adeo unitae et coniunctae atque incorporatae
sunt, ut ex duabus una prorsus cum extinctione tituli alterius evaserit</i>.</p>

<p>In praesenti autem facto quamvis ex deductis non poterat certo
determinari natura unionis, animadvertebatur tamen, non deesse indicia
quae videbantur excludere plenariam et extinctivam unionem.</p>

<p>Caeterum, subinagebatur, si Parochi iterare Missam deberent, non
ratione duplicis Paroeciae, sed solummodo ratione necessitatis, quamvis
secundam Missam ad libitum applicare possent, nullam tamen pro
hac celebratione recipere possunt eleemosynam; quod dici etiam debet
de quolibet Sacerdote qui nullam habeat animarum curam, ceu
omissis ceteris, definitum fuit in <cite>Cameracen. Missae pro Populo 25
Septemb. 1858</cite>, cuius resoluta dubia videbis inferius.</p>

<p><cite>Resolutio Dubiorum.</cite>&mdash;Sacra Congregatio Concilii die 22 Februarii
1862 respondere censuit: ad <abbr title="1">I.</abbr> et <abbr title="3">III.</abbr> <i>affirmative iudicio Episcopi,
nulla habita ratione consuetudinis, et quatenus in unoquoque casu concurrant

<p>Haec porro est indicata declaratio, ipsis verbis quibus in citata
<i>Cameracen.</i> reperitur. “De adiunctis Amplitudinis tuae precibus
cum ad SSmum. Dominum Nostrum relatum fuerit placuit cidem
Sanctitati Suae, eadem et tibi dare responsa quae ad alios quoque
Antistites, per hanc Sacram Congregationem Concilii transmissa sunt.
Ordinariorum scilicet esse de re cognoscere et perpendere, num revera
necessitas urgeat ut Sacerdos duas Missas celebrare cogatur, nec
aliter utendum concessa hac iteratione, quam iuxta conditiones ab
ipsis apponendas, habita locorum, populorum, et paucitatis Sacerdotum,
ac proinde verae necessitatis ratione de qua legatur Benedicti
XIV. Constitutio <cite>Declarasti … ad Episcopum Oscensem anni 1746</cite>,
et in eius apere <cite>De sacrificio Missae lib. 3 cap. 5, et 6</cite>. Ipsorum vero
conscientia oneratur stricte, nec permissio concedatur generaliter,
quasi privilegium alicui Sacerdoti; sed ob peculiares casus, et necessitatis
causa, ab ipso examinata, qui praeterea moneat Parochos
quibus facultatem iterum, eadem die, secundam Missam celebrandi
concesserit, ne eleemosynam vel stipendium a quovis et sub quocumque
pretextu, pro ea percipiant, iuxta decreta alias edita a S. Congregatione,
sed eam pro populo sibi commisso gratis applicent”.</p>

censuit ad secundum propositum superius dubium respondere, sunt
sequentes. Cum in <i>Cameracen.</i> quaereretur. I. “An Parochus

<p>V. “An et quomodo concedendum sit Sacerdotibus curam animarum

ARCHBISHOP OF MALINES.</p>

<div lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">
<p><span class="sc">&emsp;Eminence Révérendissime</span>,</p>

<p>Je viens avant tout confirmer par écrit la déclaration, que j’ai eu
l’honneur de vous faire oralement, de ma soumission entière et absolue
aux décrets de la S. Congrégation de. l’Index<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_23" id="fnanchor_23"></a><a href="#footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></span> de 1843 et 1844 et à
celui de Leurs Eminences les Cardinaux de l’Index et du Saint-Office,
réunis le 21 septembre 1864, avec la promesse formelle de me conformer
exactement à ces trois décrets.</p>

<p>Ensuite, sans vouloir restreindre ou affaiblir en rien cette soumission
complète, j’ai l’honneur de trasmettre à Votre Eminence les explications
que j’ai demandé de pouvoir Lui présenter, afin de justifier
ma bonne foi et de montrer que, si pendant vingt ans je n’ai pas satisfait
aux décrets de la S. Congregation de l’Index, ce n’est point par
manque de respect et de soumission aux jugements des Congrégations
romaines, mais uniquement parce que, jusqu’au moment où le
décret du 21 Septembre 1864 m’a été notifié, je croyais très-sincèrement
m’y être conformé.</p>

<p>Je déclare tout d’abord et d’une manière bien nette qu’en cela je
me suis trompé; les deux Congrégations réunies ayant décidé que
je n’avais pas satisfait, il ne saurait plus y avoir de doute à cet égard;
aussi n’y en a-t-il aucun dans ma propre pensée ni dans ma conviction
intime. Mes explications ont donc pour but unique de montrer
que pendant vingt ans j’ai été dans une erreur absolument involontaire,
et que jamais je n’ai éprouvé la moindre hésitation dans mes
sentiments de respectueuse et entière soumission aux ordres, aux conseils
et aux désirs du Saint-Siége, soumission que je considére comme
le premier devoir de tout catholique.</p>

<p>Pour qu’on puisse juger de ma bonne foi, Votre Eminence me
permettra de rappeler quelques faits et de citer quelques documents.</p>

<p>Au mois de Septembre 1843, mon ami, <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> le comte Van der Vrecken,
qui pendant l’été avait fait un voyage à Rome, m’apprit, dans
une conversation particulière, que mes ouvrages étaient déférés à la
S. Congrégation de l’Index. Craignant que mes principes n’eussent
été mal exposés, je fis des démarches pour obtenir que les chefs
<!--Page 595-->
d’accusation me fussent communiqués et qu’ainsi je pusse fournir des
explications. Deux mois plus tard, je reçus de la part du secrétaire
d’Etat, S. Em. le cardinal Lambruschini, par l’intermédiaire de Son
Excellence le Nonce apostolique et Votre Eminence Révérendissime,
les cinq propositions contenues dans le décret du 23 juin 1843.</p>

<p>La pièce qui me fut communiquée ne renfermait point les mots:
“Observationes S. Indicis Congregationis diei 23 junii 1843. <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
D. Ubaghs in sua Theodicea, et interdum etiam in Logica, subsequentes
propositiones docet, quas S. Congregatio Indici praeposita
emendandas esse judicat”. Elle ne contenait pas non plus les mots
suivants: “Hae sunt praecipuae sententiae quae in praedicto libro
corrigendae videntur. Monet igitur S. Congregatio <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Auctorem,
ut nova aliqua editione librum suum emendandum curet, atque
interim in scholasticis suis lectionibus ab iis sententiis dicendis abstinere
velit”. La pièce qui me fut remise porte simplement: “Docet
auctor in Theodicea et interdum etiam in Logica seqq. propositiones”,
avec les cinq propositions.</p>

<p>En recevant cette communication, j’ai compris que je devais fournir
des explications et des éclaircissements au sujet de ces cinq propositions.
Je croyais que la S. Congrégation de l’Index, ayant égard à
ma position de professeur à l’Université catholique de Louvain, avait
daigné m’appliquer le § 10 de la constitution de Benoit XIV, <i>Sollicita
ac provida</i>, et n’avait pas voulu porter de jugement définitif avant
de m’avoir entendu. C’est dans cette persuasion que je m’empressai
de rédiger un <i>Mémoire explicatif et justificatif</i>, que votre Eminence a
bien voulu transmettre à Rome. Un tel <i>mémoire</i>, en présence d’un
jugement que j’aurais considéré comme définitif, aurait été de ma part
un manque de respect. Ce n’est pas ainsi que la S. <a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>Congrégation
l’a apprécié. Elle a daigné accueillir mes explications avec bienveillance
comme en témoigne une lettre de Monseigneur Pecci, Nonce
apostolique à Bruxelles: cette lettre accompagnait la communication
du décret de 1844, et celle me fut transmise par Votre Eminence. En
voici la teneur:</p>

<p class="quotesig small">“Bruxelles, Nonciature Apostolique, Nᵒ 227.</p>

<p class="blockquote">&emsp;“<span class="sc">Eminence Révérendissime</span>,</p>

<p class="blockquote">“J’ai reçu de Rome la réponse qu’on attendait avec impatience en
égard de l’ouvrage du professeur Ubaghs.&mdash;Quoique les explications
que celui-ci avait remises aient été hautement appréciées, on a cru
néanmoins qu’il serait prudent et nécessaire d’introduire dans la nouvelle
réimpression les corrections qui sont marquées dans la feuille
qui m’a été envoyée par le Secrétaire d’Etat, et que j’ai l’honneur de
remettre ci-jointe à Son Eminence Votre Révérendissime, afin qu’elle
daigne de la faire parvenir au susdit Professeur avec injonction de
vouloir bien dans sa nouvelle publication se conformer aux désirs qui
par la S. Congrégation ont été manifestés, de manière qu’elle soit
réglée par les principes de sa religion et de sa probité, surtout quand
il doit parler de ce qui est trés-essentiel, c’est-à-dire de l’existence
de Dieu.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“En portant à la connaissance de S. E. Votre Rᵐᵉ le résultat de
cette affaire, je suis chargé de la part de S. Eminence le Secrétaire

et des recommandations trés-respectables de V. Eminence qu’on
a tâché que le jugement attendu fut au plutôt prononcé pour en donner
ensuite sans retardement la communication nécessaire.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“En m’acquittant ainsi des ordres qui m’ont été donnes, j’ai
l’honneur, etc., etc.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Bruxelles, 23 septembre 1844.</p>

<p class="quotesig small">“(Signe) ✠ J. Archevêque de Damiette, Nonce Apostolique.</p>

<p>Dès que j’eus reçu le décret de 1844, que cette lettre accompagnait,
je me hâtai de préparer une nouvelle édition de la Logique et
de la Théodicée, en y introduisant les corrections que j’estimais
nécessaires pour répondere aux désirs de la S. Congrégation de l’Index.</p>

<p>Ces corrections n’ont pas été suffisantes. C’est un point qui est
aujourd’hui définitivement jugé. Mais jusqu’au moment où j’ai eu
connaissance du decret du 21 septembre 1864, j’ai cru tres-sincérement
qu’elles l’étaient. Je prie Votre Eminence de me permettre
d’entrer ici dans quelques details.</p>

<p>Les faits que j’ai rappelés établissent comment j’ai été amenè à considerér
le décret de 1844 commé étant le seul décret définitif rendu à
mon égard. Quant à ce decret, il renferme, entre autres, les expressions
suivantes: “Pauca quaedam loca in opere quod a cl. viro
G. C. Ubaghs anno 1844 Lovanii editum est et inscribitur <i>Theodiceae
seu Theologiae naturalis elementa</i> adnotanda esse videntur, ut doctissimus
auctor, additis quibusdam illustrationibus, obortas circa eiusdem
operis intelligentiam difficultates e medio tollere possit……&mdash;“In
his omnibus mens doctissimi auctoris paulo clarius explicanda videtur,
ne quis inde occasionem sumat vim elevandi argumentorum quae Dei
existentiam demonstrant……&mdash;Plura alia eiusdem generis ibi obvia
sunt quae contra mentem auctoris forte in alienos sensus torqueri possent”.&mdash;Ces
termes me firent supposer que la S. Congrégation n’avait
pas voulu me signaler des erreurs de doctrine à corriger, ni des principes
faux à abandonner, mais qu’elle me demandait seulement des
éclaircissements et des explications propres à faire mieux comprendre
ma pensée. C’est là ce qui explique le langage que j’ai tenu dans la
préface de ma Logique en 1844 et dans une lettre récente à Son
Eminence le Cardinal Altieri, Préf. de la S. Congrégation de l’Index.</p>

<p>En 1845 je remis à Monseigneur Pecci, Nonce Apostolique, deux
exemplaires de la nouvelle édition de la Logique et de la Théodicée,
en priant Son Excellence de vouloir bien les faire parvenir à Rome,
afin que la S. Congrégation pût juger si les additions et les changements
introduits répondaient entièrement aux voeux exprimés par elle.
A plusieurs reprises je reçus des assurances qui me persuadérent que

<p>A brilliant writer has left a well-known sketch of the life and
bustle of the Appian Way in the days when pagan Rome was
ruler of the world. That great highway&mdash;leading from the
capital to the Eastern provinces&mdash;was ever thronged by a
<!--Page 598-->
ceaseless crowd of men, engaged in the varied business, and
swayed by the various interests, that centre in the seat of a
mighty government. Through the chair of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter, Christian
Rome has been made the seat of an empire surpassing that of
pagan Rome, by as much as the power of religion surpasses
that of the sword. Each line of the network of railways and
telegraphs with which modern progress has girded the globe, is
in itself a new Appian Way, by which some distant country
communicate, on its spiritual concerns with Rome; and there is
this difference between the pagan and the Christian governors,
that, whereas the acts of the former were of but passing interest,
those of the latter are laws forever; and while the former
concerned only individual powers or states, the latter become
directing principles for the entire Christian world. The acts
of the several congregations which assist the Holy Father
in the ecclesiastical government of the world, are of great
importance to the Church, and a knowledge of these acts
must be of the utmost value to those who govern dioceses
or parishes. Hence, all will hail with pleasure the appearance
of the first number of the monthly periodical we have now
before us. The title declares that it is not intended to publish
in it a full report of all the ecclesiastical business transacted
at Rome. A very large share of that business, of its very nature,
demands secrecy from its close connection with matters of conscience;
many other cases are of no interest except to the parties
immediately concerned; but, after these exceptions, there still
remains an ample supply of decisions which throw light upon
the practice of the Church in many things, and show how the
laws of the Church are applied to novel cases that occur as time
goes on and events progress. The <cite>Irish Ecclesiastical Record</cite>
has aimed at keeping its readers acquainted with new decisions
of this kind. The work before us proposes to effect this for all,
and to effect it fully and completely. It will do even more than
this. Besides a brief, yet clear statement of the facts of each case,
it will furnish the heads of the arguments adduced <i>pro and contra</i>
before the Congregation, either <i>ex officio</i> by the secretary of the
Congregation, or by the advocates engaged upon the case; and
finally, it will give the authentic decision of the Congregation.
Besides, it will draw attention to such theoretical or practical
principles as may be of use in dealing with similar cases whenever
they may occur, and in explanation of difficult points will
add such remarks as may be necessary. Such documents as
have been directly published by the Holy See will be given in
full whenever they regard Canon Law; in those not directly
published by the Holy See, the names of persons and places will
be thoroughly suppressed or altered, and the substance of the
<!--Page 599-->
fact only will be given in the way in which moral cases are
usually proposed.</p>

<p>The contents of the first number are as follows. After the
preface there is a full discussion of the important practical question
touching <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">missarum iterationem, applicationem missae pro
populo, et receptionem eleemosynae</i>. This discussion, with the
decision of the Congregation, etc., we have given above.</p>

<p class="hanging"><cite>Grammar of Gregorian and Modern Music.</cite> Originally compiled
by the Very <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> L. F. Renehan, <abbr title="Doctor of Divinity">D.D.</abbr>, late President
of Saint Patrick’s College, Maynooth. New and enlarged
edition, containing numerous exercises, the Gregorian Chants
for High Mass and the Divine Office; Litanies of the Blessed
Virgin, instructions regarding the use of the organ, etc. By
the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Richard Hackett, Professor, Saint Patrick’s College,
Maynooth. Dublin: James Duffy. 1865, <abbr title="24">xxiv.</abbr>&mdash;297. <abbr title="duodecimo">12mo</abbr></p>

<p>This useful book is divided into five parts. The first part
(<abbr title="pages">p.</abbr> 1-68) is a reprint of the <cite>Choir Manual</cite> published by the late
Dr. Renehan for the use of the students of Saint Patrick’s College,
Maynooth, and republished with additions in 1858 by the accomplished
editor, or rather author, of the work under notice. This
part contains a complete explanation of the theory and notation
of Gregorian music, with some elementary instructions in modern
Italian music. The remaining four parts and appendix (<abbr title="pages">p.</abbr> 69-297)
we owe to the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> R. Hackett himself. The purpose of
his labour has been to supply ecclesiastical students in this
country with a complete manual of the principal chants which
are sung at High Mass, Solemn Vespers, Benediction, Mass and
Office for the Dead, etc. With this view he has collected into
the second part an abundant supply of exercises on the intervals
ordinarily in use in Gregorian music, together with a selection
of easy chants in which these intervals occur. Part the third
contains the principal chants of the office for the dead, of the
Mass for the dead, and instructions on the method of chanting
prayers. It is greatly to be regretted that there should exist a
difference between the Roman method of chanting prayers and
that in use in some dioceses in Ireland. We hope that, as far
as Ireland is concerned, by help of the judicious selection of
<!--Page 600-->
Roman chants given in this work, we may soon be able to
say with Guidetti (quoted by our author at page 134), though in
another sense, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">semper et ubique sic cantatur</i>. The present want
of uniformity, appears still more unseemly when we learn
(p. 158) that the epistle and gospel of the Mass for the dead are
often chanted according to the Roman method in many dioceses
in which the Irish intonation is used on other occasions. Part the
fourth contains chants for High Mass. Part the fifth sets forth the
chants for vespers, chants for Holy Week, including those used
at the blessing of the oils on Holy Thursday, and miscellaneous
chants. A great deal of most useful information is condensed in
the five short appendixes which complete the work, respectively
headed: directions for the choir and organist at High Mass&mdash;use
of the organ at solemn vespers&mdash;playing of the organ at Mass
and the Divine Office, when prohibited&mdash;directions for chanting
the Divine Office&mdash;Office for the Dead&mdash;Gregorian and modern
music&mdash;character of sacred music&mdash;instrumental accompaniments
and symphonies&mdash;vernacular chants. In drawing up these instructions,
the author has had recourse to the safest guides. His
counsels are in exact accordance with the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caeremoniale Episcoporum</cite>,
the Constitution <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Annus qui nunc</cite> of Benedict XIV., the
decrees of the Sacred Congregation of Rites, and the teaching
of approved writers. The <cite>Grammar</cite> has one other merit to
which we wish to draw attention. Scattered here and there
throughout the work, wherever the subject requires or permits,
we find passages from the Milanese Councils of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Charles
Borromeo, or from the works of Cardinal Wiseman, or from
other sources, which serve to inspire youthful ecclesiastics with
a true estimate of the majesty of the Liturgy, and to draw their
attention to those treasures of tender grace which it contains.
It is pious and wise thus to remind ecclesiastics that it is the
<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vox Sponsae</em> which speaks from their lips in the Divine Office.</p>

were increased to half a million. They had, therefore, all along doubled their
number in twenty-five years. In New Jersey the period of doubling appeared to
be twenty-two years, and in Rhode Island still less. In the back settlements,
where the inhabitants applied themselves solely to agriculture, and luxury was not
known, they were supposed to double their number in fifteen years”. He adds in
a note: “Speaking of Rhode Island, Dr. Styles says that though the period of
doubling for the whole colony is twenty-five years, yet that it is different in different

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
